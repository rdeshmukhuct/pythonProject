phase shivering may also observed response provide endogenous heat
initial phase core increasing sk decreasing
core stabilises thermoregulation continues normothermia reestablished
second phase fever core elevated sk may also slightly elevated
last phase fever reduction core occurs due reduction metabolic rate prefever levels vasodilatory response increase heat loss
phase sweating may initiated individual perceives elevated core
third phase core decreasing sk high absence sweating reduced sweating initiated
therefore unlikely irt infer febrile state elevated sk phases pyrexia
