The Dow Jones Industrial Average took a pause in today's stock market after a few days of strong rallying. The S&P 500 was trading mildly lower around noon Eastern time, while techs were trying to hold on to this week's nice gains.

After two days of powerful rallying, Thursday's trading action was stifled by an unanticipated rise in unemployment. Ahead of the market open, the Labor Department reported a surprise increase in initial jobless claims. New filings for unemployment totaled 419,000 last week, sharply above the 350,000 consensus estimate.

Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield, which continues to be an important data point amid the economic recovery, hit a low of 1.13% earlier this week. After a rebound on Wednesday, the yield slid back to 1.23% on Thursday as money dripped back into bonds. The bond market continues to fluctuate between its recent March high of 1.76% and lows around 1.13%. Both inflation and Covid worries are key movers for the bond market.

Dow Jones Today

The Nasdaq traded up as much as 0.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1% after paring an earlier loss, then dropped below breakeven again. The Dow Jones industrials held a small loss of 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index traded more than 1.8% lower, leading the downside. Volume was lower on both the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday.

Stocks underperforming in the Dow Jones on Thursday included Intel (INTC) as shares fell 0.7% ahead of this afternoon's earnings. It reports after the close. Analysts expect the chip giant to earn $1.07 a share on sales of $17.8 billion. The stock is trying to regain its key 50-day line, but is still nearly 20% from its 52-week high.

On the upside, shares of McDonald's (MCD) rose 0.7% and are trading just below the new 238.28 buy point in a flat base, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. The stock reclaimed its key 50-day moving average during Tuesday's rebound. The firm will report earnings on July 28.

Growth Stocks To Watch

The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) declined roughly 0.2% on Thursday. Shares have regained support at their 200-day moving average and are attempting to retake the 50-day line as well. The ETF has had a powerful week, rising over 5% thus far. Stocks leading the downside in the index on Thursday included Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) (down 6% on Thursday) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) (down 3% on Thursday).

Social media stocks Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) are set to report their quarterly results after the close Thursday.

Analysts expect Snap to lose 18 cents per share on revenue of $845 million. Shares are building a cup-with-handle base with a 70.34 buy point. Shares traded down 2.3% Thursday morning and are trying to gain support at the 50-day moving average.

Analysts expect Twitter to earn 7 cents a share on sales of $1.06 billion.

The stock is building a double-bottom base with a handle that offers a 72.17 entry. Twitter shares lost 0.5% early Thursday.

Finally, chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is building a cup-with-handle base that offers a 95.54 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. Shares reversed early losses on Thursday to a 1.2% gain and are on pace to notch a four-day win streak.

AMD stock was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.

On Friday, IBD downgraded its market outlook to "uptrend under pressure." This means that investors should be more conservative when initiating stock positions. Also, consider taking profits where possible and be extra picky about taking on more risk at this time.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Ultra Clean First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rhonda Bennetto, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Rhonda Bennetto -- Vice President, Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Jim Scholhamer, Chief Executive Officer; and Sheri Savage, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will begin with some prepared remarks about the business, and Sheri will follow with the financial review. Then we'll open up the call for questions.

Today's call contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections and assumptions as of today, and we assume no obligation to update them after this call. Discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can be found in today's press release posted on our website.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda, and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate your time today. I'm going to start with a brief review of our fourth quarter performance, while sharing my thoughts on the industry and how accelerated technology advancements are benefiting UCT. After that, I'll turn the call over to Sheri for a review of our financial results and activities, then we will open up the call for questions.

UCT again delivered record revenue growth, above expectations for the first quarter driven by solid execution on higher-than-expected demand across both our products and services markets. I sincerely thank the thousands of employees around the world who collectively pulled together to anticipate, commit and deliver the best possible results for our customers, our company and our shareholders. By making important continuous investments in our people, our facilities, our products and our services, we have grown our revenue by 30% and our earnings by 70% year-over-year.

Because our strategic investments in our businesses are closely aligned with the needs of our customers, I am more confident than ever that we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term increase in industry demand. UCT, remains solidly on track to outpace the accelerated growth of our served markets again this year. The buildup of digital infrastructure that accelerated last year because of the pandemic along with an expedited recovery in the need for semiconductors is fueling overall growth. This has resulted in a considerable increase in productivity for our customers across all market segments, compared to just three months ago.

Our customers and their customers are making significant investments in response to projected strong multi-year growth due to secular trends such as 5G, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. These investments have effectively reset equipment spending expectations to a much higher level for the foreseeable future. Our products business is strategically positioned to benefit from this increase due to our very broad exposure across all device types. And our services business will profit from the increase in fab utilization rates.

One of our most important accomplishments this past quarter was the closing of the Ham-Let acquisition. The addition of Ham-Let's high purity flow control systems, means we can now offer our customers a more diversified set of product offerings. This enables us to play an increasingly important and pivotal role in meeting our customers' needs from the design processes, all the way to the support and service maintenance requirements found in any high volume manufacturing fab. And the timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better.

Ham-Let's gas delivery capabilities not only play an important role within the equipment space, but also within the sub-fab infrastructure build-out phase. And capex for this project is on the rise. With Intel recently announcing the spend an additional $20 billion TSMC and SK hynix during the lease spend $100 billion and Samsung reaffirming your $100 billion investment over the coming years. We plan to leverage existing relationships with our customers and see a clear opportunity to participate in the multi-year build-out of these foundry, logic and memory fabs.

UCT's new facility in Malaysia remains on track to begin production in the third quarter. This state of the art facility is being built to support revenue run rate of $600 million to $800 million annually when fully ramped enabling us to better serve and bring value to our local and global customer base. Hiring began earlier this year in many employees are already being trained. We are uniquely positioned to support our customers and grow our share as outsourcing opportunity to gain momentum.

Another major achievement this quarter with the UCT was awarded Intel 2020 supplier Achievement Award for COVID-19 response. We were one of only 38 suppliers in the Intel supply chain to receive such an award. And I would like to thank Intel for the prestigious recognition and all our employees for their hard work. This award is a testament to our dedication and deep commitment to our customers and underscores why UCT is a partner of choice.

I mentioned this last quarter, it's even more meaningful today, there is never been a better more opportune time to be the manufacturing leader in the semiconductor industry. Our growing portfolio of product and service offerings together with our strong operational performance and resilient business model will drive continuous long-term growth and profitability with the goal of returning even more value to our shareholders.

The addition of Ham-Let share gain an unprecedented levels of demand all contributed toward substantial increase in revenue guidance for the second quarter. Industry sentiment backed by our internal market analysis projects strong sustainable momentum and UCT is poised to continue to outperform through 2021 and beyond.

Before handing the call over to Sheri, I want to again thank our employees and our suppliers and partners for their incredibly hard work. And we look forward to speaking with you again in a few months.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sheri, to review our financial activities and performance. Sheri?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. In today's discussion, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers only. Total revenue for the quarter was $417.6 million, up 13% from the prior quarter. Our products division was up 15.4% to $345.6 million and our services business grew 2.7% to $72 million both on increased demand across the board. Total gross margin for the first quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.3% compared to 21.5% last quarter.

Products gross margin was 18.2% compared to 17.8%. And services was 36% compared to 37.5% last quarter. Margins can be influenced by customer concentration, geography, product mix and volume. So you can expect to see variances quarter-to-quarter. Operating expense for the quarter was $38.1 million compared to $35.7 million in Q4, due to typical costs related to year-end and increased headcount in support of the ramp.

As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses decreased to 9.1% compared to 9.7% in the prior quarter. Total operating margin for the quarter increased to 12.2% compared to 11.9% in the fourth quarter. Margins from our products division grew to 11.7% from 10.8% in the prior quarter and margin from our services division was 14.3% compared to 16.3% in the prior quarter.

Based on $41.6 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92 on net income of $38.2 million compared to $0.81 on net income of $33.5 million in the prior quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter remained unchanged from last quarter at 18%. We expect our tax rate for 2021 to stay in the high teens.

Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents were $264.3 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $200.3 million last quarter. Cash from operations was very strong at $55.6 million, an increase of $21.2 million from the prior quarter.

In the first quarter, we refinanced our term loan to fund the Ham-Let acquisition. The offering was comprised of $355 million incremental debt and included the repricing of our existing $273 million loan. The offering was approximately four times oversubscribed and resulted in a new Term B loan totaling $628 million at an interest rate of 375 plus LIBOR, compared to 450 plus LIBOR for the original loan. We are very pleased with the strong investor interest and result in term of the new loan.

In addition, on April 8th, we completed a public offering of 3.2 million shares at $55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $175 million. Use of the proceeds will be used to fund our growth strategy, which may include capital expenditures and future M&A. These financing activities will be reflected in our Q2 financials. With the completion of our refinancing in our equity offering, we are well positioned to capitalize on expansion opportunities while maintaining an ideal level of operating leverage.

To continue to meet accelerated demand and including a full quarter of revenue from Ham-Let, we anticipate revenue for the second quarter to be between $490 million and $520 million, an increase of 21%, using the midpoint. Excluding Ham-Let, UCT's core business would have been guided up approximately 8%. We expect EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1.3. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.

Pardon me, Quinn. If you're talking, we cannot hear you. Your line might be muted.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Sorry, yes. I was muted. Apologies. Congratulations guys on the nice results and guidance. Sheri, I wanted to start with the financial guidance for the June quarter. If I've got my numbers right, is the core UCT business up 8% would be guided to roughly $450 million, and then the difference would be Ham-Let contribution?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, that's correct.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great. Second question perhaps for Jim. Just as you look at your -- how the company's positioned in 2021. You've talked about being able to grow faster than WFE in the industry, and I guess I'm wondering do you think the core SSP and SPS businesses are growing in line faster than WFE, if you were to exclude that Ham-Let acquisition?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Hi, Quinn. Definitely on the SPS side, obviously we're seeing very strong growth quarter-on-quarter, and I think we expect to see that. And we're really looking forward to our increased capacity coming out of Malaysia in the last half of the year, that really help with that. As you know on the services side, the cleaning side that grows more along with wafer starts. So we expect to see that grow more in line with the wafer start growth or hopefully slightly above that as we work through our programs.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great. And then just I guess last one for me. The strength of results, just from the broader semi-cap companies that have reported to date seem to be raising fears again about a near-term peak. Can you make any comments about how you see the second half of the year? Do you think it's sort of flat with the higher first half? Do you think the business can continue to grow half-over-half in the second half?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

I'd say it's safe to say, we see no reason why it couldn't continue to grow throughout the year.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great. All right. I get back in the queue.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Quinn.

Operator

The next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Thank you very much. And also, congrats on the really nice quarter and outlook. Jim, maybe first off, you guys did a great job last year in terms of procuring supplies and meeting customer demand. There are very challenging period with the pandemic. This year we're starting off where demand is obviously exceeding everyone's expectations. I guess what lessons you learned from last year that you're applying this year? And how are you keeping pace with a lot of your customers demand needs, because again the demand expectations have significantly risen in the short-term, and your results obviously indicate you're keeping pace with what your customers need. Anything that you've learned from last year that you are applying this year, or are you just, just able to meet a lot of that I guess excess demand?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Hi, Patrick. Yes, that's definitely --- you're absolutely right. It's very constrained environment right now. I think one of the big things and I think our customers also learn that it's really to take the projection and the commitment back as far as you can through the supply chain, through your suppliers and through your suppliers' suppliers, and really operate beyond a PO-to-PO kind of basis, and work more and a forecast, and a partnership kind basis with the suppliers. So I think we've done a good job with that. There is always more to do, but I think the industry has moved away from being transactional to being more of a partnership, all the way back to the supply chain.

Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Great, that's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question in terms of the new facility in Malaysia. Traditionally in your new facilities tend to weigh a little bit of cost as you're working through some duplicate costs, and things of that nature with the new facility ramp, but given the current environment and the expectations as we go into the second half of the year. I mean Sheri, maybe you can give a little color on the potential impacts to gross margin, or if there are any given that the demand environment could absorb a lot of in a much quicker fashion?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Patrick, you're right. With the volumes that we're seeing, we're not seeing as much impact on the margins as we move through the year. So we're seeing obviously the volumes to be very, very high in other locations, which offsets those additional costs coming in, and we are utilizing that labor for within Asia to help us with with that output, within those other facilities. So I would kind of think about Malaysia and Singapore almost been a combined entity when we look at those cost, and those are actually assisting us with meeting the demand that we need. So it's not putting as much pressure on had we not been in this situation from a volume perspective.

Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Great. Thank you again, and keep up the good work.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Patrick.

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. First, a couple of housekeeping for Sheri. What is the new share count? What are you projecting the interest expense to be going forward?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. We expect the interest expense to be closer to $5 million. The new share count adds 3.2 million shares to our current account. So closer to 45 million from a share count perspective. I can give you the exact numbers a little bit later, but that's the -- where we anticipate being.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. Great. Just want to make sure, I mean, and then Jim, when you look at the Ham-Let business, does that -- do those products grow with WFE, and then I guess you would expect the customer response so far view controlling it, and what is the timing for getting more of their products into your gas pedal?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So, Tom. Thanks. Yeah, as -- I think we've elaborated earlier, about 60% of their revenue is semiconductor-related. And yeah, we would expect that to grow with the WFE in the short-term, and actually as we're seeing actually in the short, medium-term potentially outgrowing that as well. In the long-term, I think we see, like the two to three year period we see a lot of opportunity to make huge gains in the market share of the Ham-Let components in this space. And so that's a percentage that is actually relatively high. But I think to think of it in the next year, we expect Ham-Let as an entity to at least grow along with WFE, and our gain is -- our goal is to continue to make that outgrow WFE, just like we do in our base business.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great. And then, what are your assumptions for the non-semi part of that business? Is that fairly flat?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we are seeing the semi-part so strong, that I would actually say the whole company is growing along with WFE or maybe ahead of that, but the non-semi part, it's kind of the case of like hits and hits and and other misses. I think the liquid nitrogen gas starting to show some signs of life. We're starting to see some activity there. We're really starting to just learn about those other parts, and trying to get a feel for how those industries might grow or change over the course of time, but I think a simple way to think about it is, we expect Ham-Let as a whole, at least grow along with WFE, the combination of the two sides of the business, and hopefully beat that by the normal 10 points that we do.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great. And then finally, congratulations on the Intel Supplier Award. Was that for the Clean business?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Yes, it was. That for our response to COVID, which actually both sides of our business did a great job, but, yeah, that was in particular to our ability to really use our global footprint to really keep the Intel fabs moving and flowing. When one factory would be hit by COVID, we are able to use our footprint to really move things around and be adaptive and flexible and we are very delighted to be recognized by Intel for that.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great, thank you for your time.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Tom.

Operator

Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hey, congratulations guys on a great quarter and solid outlook. Going back to Malaysia, if we kind of look at Singapore and Malaysia as a combined basis. Is there any way, when the capacity is fully online and Asia, Malaysia, excuse me, the incremental revenue opportunity in the Company. In other words, today we have X amount of opportunity a year, a quarter and then after Malaysia is fully ramped its this much bigger?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah so, Christian. Yeah, I think we're looking at Malaysia of adding $600 million to $800 million annually of more capacity, right now, it is a very symbiotic nature with Singapore as we move things back and forth as we're still finishing up the building right now. But yeah, I think in the end of the day, Malaysia should all in had $600 million, $800 million in additional revenue annually to us.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

And would per -- how utilized is that currently?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

It's not finished being built yet, so we're ramping it in the third quarter. So, we're utilizing some of the employees that we have hired for it with the Singapore operations to help deal with the high demand out there. But at this at this point we're still just starting up and finishing off the building.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Fabulous. That's what I thought. So, if we look to the huge or stronger meaningful whatever adjective you want to use, multi-year CapEx spending environment by the world's largest spenders and your largest customers as that kicks in, in Q3 you should be very well positioned for that strength and potential market share gains. Is that fair?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Absolutely. And actually, we're seeing different projects that we're winning are actually going straight into Malaysia production as the initial production site, which is, which is highly unusual with the new production site. So, I think the environment is so that new capacity coming on board right now is a very valuable commodity. So, we're seeing a great reception from our customers to move product either from their own factories or from other sources to our new Malaysian sites. So, we have pretty high expectations of our ability to use that, that new capacity coming online right, I would say, right in the nick of time.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Yeah. So, if you look at Malaysia coming online. And then you look at all the new fab builds in your opportunity with Ham-Let there as well as more equipment for Quantum to clean, it seems to me, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems to me that your ability to outgrow the market over the next 2 to 3 years could even be more meaningful than it has been in the last few years?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think that's a fair statement. 10% has been our average outgrowth of the market, but we certainly strive to do much more than that, especially with the acquisitions. So, we are definitely looking at outpacing the market by at least 10% and obviously more if we can, and the addition of Malaysia sets us up really nicely for that.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. I don't have any other questions. Great. Congrats again.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Christian.

Operator

The next question comes again from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Hey, Jim. Just two follow-ups. The first sort of a follow-up to Christian's question, just as you look at your share gains, how much is that being driven by the COVID supply chain tightness and OEMs being willing to sort of open up new second sources or additional sources of supply, whether that's in your core business or opportunities for Ham-Let?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, Quinn, I think the COVID impact, I think we've seen a lot of that already flow through. I think the majority of what we're seeing is just simply an overall need for capacity in the overall ability to build the equipment. I think we've all seen this before. Obviously, the capacity coming online right now, certainly -- it's certainly an opportune time for us. And I think the majority of the impact is simply -- the demand is very strong for equipment and the ability for whoever can deliver right now. You're right, I mean there is a level of COVID, but there's also an openness to opening up avenues to reach the deliverable -- reach the delivery needs of the end customers. So, I think I think at the end of the day, the biggest stress is simply the overall need for capacity in the industry.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great. The second question is a follow-up on Ham-Let in the in-sourcing opportunity to extent you qualify Ham-Let components in your gas panels. I guess that doesn't show up as revenue since it's included in your gas panel. But it shows up as margin enhancement. So, I guess two questions, one, when you talked about Ham-Let growing in line or faster than WFE, I assume that that excludes the opportunity to in-source components to UCT gas panels. But I just wanted to confirm that?

And then the second question is, can you kind of walk us through the math. What's the opportunity as you in-sources highlight components in your gas panels? How much of a margin boost do you think you could see?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

To the first question is, yes, it does exclude in-sourcing or internal transactions as far as the growth that we're seeing on the Ham-Let side. On the -- the overall potential to grow, I think there's several areas that are driving that. Certainly, there is OEMs and their requirements as well as some of the chipmakers and there's a lot of new fab announcements as well as I think you've all seen and those fabs demand a lot of the same type of components that are used on the OEM equipment. So, I think we're seeing pretty strong demand over the next several years across the board.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Thank you, Jim.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Quinn.

Operator

The next question comes from Dick Ryan with Colliers. Please go ahead.

Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Thank you. A couple for Sheri. Sheri, do you have any debt pay down goals, what you might be looking at for this year?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely Dick. We plan to substantially pay off some of the debt this year with our cash flow that we've generated. So, I would say, our goal is around $50 million for the year.

Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay. And obviously with the addition of Ham-Let and the trends underlying the market. Can we expect any kind of operating model updates from you guys in the next coming quarters?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So, obviously we just to close the acquisition to where we have identified synergies and we do see that we will be updating. We will need to update our model as we move through the next quarter or two. We see an overall update potentially to gross margin. And then ultimately, they will assist us with updating our operating margin as we go into next year, but we will make an update in the next quarter or two as we see how they perform and how the synergies flow-through that we anticipate happening shorter term.

Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay, good. And Jim, what kind of base or operating assumptions are you using for WFE and wafer starts?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

I think WFE, we're looking at the same assumptions that that the overall market is looking at 20% to 22% increase in WFE. Wafer starts, I think the latest numbers there are coming out pretty quickly and often I think they are in the high single digits maybe the low double digits, we could look that up for you what our latest market forecast is.

Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

No, that's just a range. That's good. I appreciate. Thank you and congratulations as well.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Dick.

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes again from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Thank you for taking my follow-up question. Jim, maybe a bigger picture question on the services side, and in the parts cleaning. Obviously fab utilization is the biggest driver for demand in that business. But with some of your major customers at the most leading edge of both the foundry logic, as well as the memory side of things. The complexities of manufacturing these next generation devices, quote enhancing the need for parts cleaning? And what I'm getting by that is again utilization is probably the biggest driver, but because yield is becoming so much more and more important at the most advanced nodes, that's driving, yeah, I guess, incremental needs for parts cleaning to ensure that the tools keep running at the highest throughputs and yields.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. That's a good point, Patrick. I think what we're also seeing -- you're right, at the advanced node, the parts cleaning this cycle seems to be more vigorous in order to keep the yields up. But what we're also starting to see is advanced coatings are becoming a really important factor. So there used to be a clean the part, you return it, now -- and there's always been certain coatings that are applied to the parts for certain reasons. As we move down to 7 and to 5 and to 3 nanometer, we're starting to see specialty coatings and surface texturing becoming a more important player.

So not just not just cleaning the parts, but also applying these special coatings and texturing. And so it's growing, I mean obviously it's a very small revenue overall, compared to overall cleaning at this point, but we're seeing the growth in that space is really kind of off the charts, and we think that's an area that's really going to take off in the next few years, which is really a lot more around cleaning plus, and that's where we have a great position and we're doing a lot of work with the leading IDMs in that space.

Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Operator

There are no further questions. So I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Scholhamer for any closing remarks.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you very much.

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Ultra Clean Holdings

Crunching the numbers

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$62.0m US$141.0m US$153.7m US$164.4m US$173.3m US$181.0m US$187.6m US$193.6m US$199.0m US$204.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 9.04% Est @ 6.92% Est @ 5.44% Est @ 4.41% Est @ 3.68% Est @ 3.17% Est @ 2.82% Est @ 2.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$57.6 US$122 US$123 US$123 US$120 US$116 US$112 US$108 US$103 US$98.0

("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.1b

Story continues

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2030 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$204m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$3.7b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.7b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$1.8b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$57.4, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

dcf

The assumptions

The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ultra Clean Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.192. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Looking Ahead:

Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Ultra Clean Holdings, we've compiled three essential aspects you should assess:

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good afternoon and welcome to the Ultra Clean Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rhonda Bennetto, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Rhonda Bennetto -- Vice President, Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today are Jim Scholhamer, Chief Executive Officer and Sheri Savage, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will begin with some prepared remarks about the business and Sheri will follow with the financial review and then we'll open up the call for questions.

Today's call contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings. All forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections and assumptions as of today and we assume no obligation to update them after this call. Discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can be found in today's press release posted on our website.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda, and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate your time today. I am going to start with a short review of our full-year results and briefly touch on our fourth-quarter performance. Then I'll share my thoughts on the industry and how technology advancements are benefiting UCT as we execute on our growth strategy before turning the call over to Sheri for a financial review. Then we will open up the call for questions.

For many reasons 2020 was unlike any year we've ever seen. But by every measure, it was an extraordinary one for UCT. I must start by thanking our global employees for their commitment, resiliency, determination and drive to be the best. The team rose to the challenge and continued to exemplify our culture of integrity and teamwork producing some of the best financial results we have seen in our 30-year history.

UCT ended 2020 with a record total revenue of $1.4 billion, record operating margin of 11.3% and record EPS of $2.80. While significantly outgrowing the overall WFE market by 11%, to reach these extraordinary milestones in a year for all the challenges, we continuously adjusted to the changing work environment while staying focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong return to shareholders. The fourth quarter benefited from ongoing strength in foundry and logic as well as increased demand in memory as customers plan for expansion and equipment investment in 2021 and beyond. Both our product and service divisions saw increased engagement across all segments of the market, resulting in another quarter of growth and improved operating leverage. UCT remains solidly on track to outpace the accelerated growth of our served markets again in 2021.

Technology advancements within our data-driven economy continue to fundamentally change how we live and work. This digital transformation is accelerating the adoption of semiconductor growth drivers such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, IoT and 5G. Capital intensity at the leading edge is increasing to support a more diverse set of end used markets which provides confidence for strong multi-year WFE demand. Our business is well balanced and both our product and service businesses have broad exposure across all device types. This bodes well for UCT as we continue to engage in the early stages of customers' technology roadmaps.

A key component to UCT delivering on its long-term growth strategy is the acquisition of Hamlet. The pre-close and integration planning process is going very smoothly and we are excited to begin operating as one company after closing likely early in the second quarter. Adding Hamlet to our growing suite of vertical capabilities will support our customer partnerships with a significantly broader higher value, higher margin portfolio of market-leading product solutions. You will recall that Hamlet's components are used primarily within our current gas panel product line as well as for gas distribution throughout semiconductor tools.

In addition, gas delivery is a significant element of the sub-fab infrastructure within chip making facilities, providing an additional platform for growth. By leveraging UCT's solid customer relationships and global operational footprint, we see a sizable opportunity to grow Hamlet's 5% share of a $2 billion market.

UCT's new facility in Malaysia remains on track to begin initial production in the third quarter this year. This state-of-the-art facility will enable us to better serve and bring value to our local and global customer base. The facility enables us to provide additional capacity ensuring business continuity to meet ongoing demand.

There has never been a better and more opportune time to be a manufacturing leader in the semiconductor industry. Our customers and their customers are well positioned at the forefront of this technology renaissance and we see our existing partnerships expanding with them as they hasten to advance their technology roadmaps.

Our comprehensive portfolio of products and service offerings together with our strong fiscal discipline and resilient business model will drive continuous long-term performance and profitability with the goal of returning even more value to our shareholders. Our guidance for the first quarter reflect an increase in business across our entire customer base. Industry sentiment backed by our internal market analysis project momentum continuing through 2021.

Before handing the call over to Sheri, I want to again thank our employees and our suppliers for their incredibly hard work this past year and we look forward to again outperforming the markets we serve in 2021.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sheri to review our financial performance.

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. In today's discussion, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers only. Total revenue for the quarter was $369.6 million, up 1.7% from the prior quarter. Our products division grew 1.7% to $299.5 million and our services business was up 1.8% to $70.1 million, both on increased demand across the customer base.

Total revenue for the year was a record $1.4 billion, up 31.2% from the prior year. Products generated revenue of $1.1 billion and services contributed $267.4 million, up 34.5% and 18.7% over 2019 respectively. Total gross margin for the fourth quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.5% compared to 21% last quarter.

Products gross margin was 17.8% compared to 17.5% and services gross margin was 37.5% compared to 36% last quarter. Margins can be influenced by customer concentration, geography, product mix and volume. So you can expect variances quarter to quarter.

Total gross margin for the year was 21.4%, up from 19.3% in the prior year. Once the Hamlet acquisition is closed, we will take the opportunity to review and adjust our model. Operating expenses for the quarter were $35.7 million compared to $34.3 million in Q3 due to typical costs related to year-end. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to 9.7% compared to 9.4% in the prior quarter. As a result of our revenue increasing by 31.2% year-over-year, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 10.1% compared to 11.5% in the prior period.

Total operating margin for the quarter increased to 11.9% compared to 11.6% in the third quarter. Margin from our products division remained flat at 10.8% and margin from our services division was 16.3% compared to 14.9% in the prior quarter. Total operating margin for the year was 11.3%, a significant improvement from 7.8% in the prior year due to higher volumes and ongoing management of expenses.

Based on 41.4 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.81 on net income of $33.5 million compared to $0.73 on net income of $29.9 million in the prior quarter. For the full year earnings per share were $2.80 on net income of $115 million, compared to $1.16 on net income of $46.5 million in 2019.

Our tax rate for the year was 18% compared to 18.1% last quarter. For the full year our tax rate was 18.4%. We expect our tax rate for 2021 to remain in the high teens.

Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents were $200.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $176.1 million last quarter. Cash from operations was $44.4 million, an increase of $24.7 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, our cash from operations totaled $97.3 million.

We have made significant progress paying down our Term B loan over the last couple of years. During 2020 we made additional voluntary Term B loan payments totaling $18.4 million, bringing our total debt repayment for the year to $25 million. A key component of our overall growth strategy is to ensure we are ready to capitalize on expansion opportunities while maintaining an ideal level of operating leverage. As mentioned in our last call, we are currently reviewing our capital structure to support this strategy so that we may conserve a healthy balance sheet and maintain flexibility. We anticipate revenue for the first quarter to be between $375 million and $405 million and EPS in the range of $0.80 to $0.93.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Yeah. Good afternoon. First, I wanted to check on the Hamlet acquisition. It sounds like the close has moved from the first quarter into the second quarter. And I was wondering if there is any big hiccups at this point.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Hi, Tom. We really don't consider the close moving. We talked about it being end of the first quarter, early second quarter and we are still projecting in that time frame, again most likely early second quarter.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Okay.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

We're still waiting for one clearance from one government, but we don't see that there'll be any issues with that.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Okay. That sounds good. And then when you look at the ramp in Malaysia, it sounds like it's on track for the third quarter. What do you do between then and now to ramp up capacity if you need it? Obviously things are getting stronger in the first quarter, [Indecipherable] grow again in the second quarter, will you have enough capacity on hand before the facility is done to handle?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, absolutely. I mean, we always have a significant amount of first capacity and different things that we can do with overtime and extended shifts and things like that. So we definitely -- it's not a concern in the short term.

Obviously, as we see '21 and '22 continuing to strengthen in the long term that additional capacity in Malaysia is going to really pay off for us. But, yeah, there'll be no constraints in the near term.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Okay. And then final question. When you look at the kind of consensus view out there for 15% growth in the industry, everything you've seen correlate with that?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, yeah. We see -- obviously the 15% number that a lot of people are talking about definitely seems like a reasonable estimate. There have been a lot of announcements, especially in the foundry side of things to support that and as well as memory moving into more capacity adds in this year versus the node expansions that they were mostly focused on last year. So we still think everything planning up really well for strong growth in that range for 2021.

Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst

Great. I appreciate your time today.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Tom.

Operator

The next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for [Phonetic] question. I had a couple of them, Jim. Just to follow up on Tom's last question, you said that you expect the outperformance to continue. So if you think WFE is going to be up 15% this year, is it fair to assume your revenues could be higher than that?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, obviously we're not guiding for all of 2021, but our target is to always outgrow WFE and we've outgrown that on an average of about 10 points over the last five or six years and obviously some years are higher and some are lower than others depending on many factors. But, yeah, our aim is to continue to outgrow WFE by roughly on average of 10 points.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Got it, got it. And then, Jim, I think in the last call you kind of spoke about some potential approved design wins at ASML. I'm kind of curious, when do you think the transition to tangible revenue?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. As I mentioned that's kind of a long-term goal over a few years and there are several reasons. A lot of the wins and a lot of the work that we're doing are on the next-generation tools in the litho space. And so those obviously have to go and get adopted and they have to ramp up on their own.

And also the wins -- the wins come in -- they come in chunks along the way. They don't come in one big movement of operations from -- into ours. So you see -- on any given quarter, you'll see several wins in certain sub modules and modules or components and those continue to kind of stack up on each other over time as well as the new tools really start to roll out as they introduce them to the market. That's the -- that's where we see kind of a slow general growth over the next several years and our target to get that space up to a reportable segment.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Jim, and then the final question for Sheri. It looks like the Malaysia facility is on track for a second-half ramp. I'm just curious how should I think about gross margin at least in the second half of this year as that facility ramps up?

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I think we'll take a look at how that will affect our model over the course of the year. Right now we see ourselves still at the high end of our model, especially now that we're starting to get into the $1.5 billion to $2 billion bucket that we put out in our model. So we'll see some increase in margin, but we will see how that flows through with the volume of revenue that flows in at the latter half of the year.

Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Got it. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Sheri.

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

The next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Congratulations. Just wanted to follow up on the last question just about the gross margin effect from Malaysia, I assume that as that comes online, you are saying that you think that that's margin accretive and could be a tailwind in the second half. I just want to make sure I got your comment correctly.

Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So it just really depends on the amount of volume going through. So obviously, it is a lower-cost region for us, and that will obviously help us from a labor perspective. The volume is really the key thing there in terms of how much goes through, but yes, it could be helpful to get us continue to have us be at the higher end of our gross margin model and possible expansion. We will be looking at our model, as mentioned before, once the Hamlet acquisition comes into play and we will be taking a look holistically across all of our product lines to provide a updated model based upon that.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great. Second question for me. The services business actually growing in the fourth quarter, surprised to say, I thought you were looking for potentially a step back in that business in the December quarter as one of your large customers went through a fab transition. It doesn't look like that had an impact on the business. So just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the services business and do you expect that to grow in -- sequentially in the March quarter?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We saw some -- yeah, you're right, we definitely saw a temporary slowdown in the -- from the Israel logic site as we had talked about before. We saw a little bit more strength in the memory side of things in Korea than what we had anticipated. And I think we do see that will continuing. And then with the fab conversion kind of coming back in logic in Israel there, we would expect to see service continue to grow sequentially over the next quarters.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great. And then the last question for me. I understand you're not giving guidance for the full year. But sounds like 15% WFE growth you guys target growing faster than that. Could you make any comments about linearity sort of first half versus second half? Has there been -- there has been some debate in the industry as to whether it's a front-half weighted year or more of a balanced or even a second-half weighted year. Just any thoughts you have on kind of first half versus second half would be helpful.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, yeah. We've been following those comments as well. Obviously the first half benefits from improved visibility and it looks pretty strong. As we look at the end market fundamentals though, I think a lot of the second half and 2022 and increasing the strength kind of compounding from that it's kind of a little bit dependent on some more NAND capacity adds versus the technology moves and also memory, which is starting to add capacity continuing to accelerate. So it's difficult -- it's really difficult to call.

I mean, obviously people call in the first half because that's where we could see pretty clearly. But I don't know if I would call -- I would make a call at this point that the first half is going to be stronger than the second half. It's really -- I think it's really too early. I had a look at it. The first half is pretty strong, very strong and then we see a lot of downstream indicators that there is no reason why the second half shouldn't continue. But there is always the caveat of any unusual events that occur. So it's really too early to say. I think the entire year being pretty strong -- definitely there is a consensus on that and if there is any waiting, I don't think it would be significant. That's kind of my view.

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great. Thank you, Jim.

The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.

Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a really nice end to the year. Jim, maybe first off staying on the services side for a second. On the parts cleaning business typically utilization rates are a key driver for that business and obviously saw that on the memory front. But did you talk about any potential incremental increases in that business due to the complexities of devices? Maybe more specifically on memory both for NAND and DRAM as they get more complex, do you see increasing I guess content or increasing services use because of the complexities of those devices on top of high utilization rates?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption that definitely you could see the cleaning cycles accelerate like they are toward the leading nodes and not logic which would obviously cause a higher cleaning intensity, if you would. And in addition to that, it also requires more of the leading edge kind of cleaning applications and more complex approaches to it, which obviously fits well into our bailiwick.

And then third, then you still have logic pushing some pretty extreme dimensions with 7 and 5 and 3 nanometer, which is adding new requirements to cleaning, which is -- so the coating and the texturing of the parts for yield and particle controls starting to become a more significant added process that you don't tend to see at those older node. So I think there's kind of three factors that really come into play that should help the cleaning -- the cleaning and the analytics business to really maybe start to part ways with wafer starts and actually become grow a little faster. But I think it's kind of early days to see how that happens. But I think that's definitely something kind of cooking as those forces are building up.

You're also seeing a lot of those devices start moving into more vacuum based. I think even some of the litho applications are starting to become more vacuum based. So you see another tailwind coming on there. So all those things added together bodes pretty well for that segment of the industry to really grow at an accelerated rate.

Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great. That's helpful, Jim. Maybe as my follow-up question you guys performed really well last year in 2020 despite the pandemic issues. Can you describe the supply chain situation that you have right now? And whether you feel you can meet the increasing demand that we're seeing in the current environment?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I think in Asia the factors on the COVID and supply chain the last few quarters has been minimal to almost nothing. Obviously in the US and in Europe, to some extent too around the holiday season it was definitely something in the fourth quarter that we had to deal with with the suppliers UCTs hasn't been directly impacted in any way -- any significant way by any COVID events. And we saw that at the beginning of the quarter that we're in, but I think we're seeing less and less of COVID related supplier issues. It's now -- it's the typical issues when you're ramping the supplier issues that come up. But it's not so at this point. At this point in time it, knock on wood, it hasn't been anything that has been really materially impacting our ability to get our output.

Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Patrick.

The next question is from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. Hey, Jim, I just have one quick question, follow-up on memory. Have you seen any change in the last 90 days your outlook between DRAM and NAND?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Not much of a change. I mean, NAND is still kind of where we thought that people starting to continuing the transition to the 128 layers. I think in the last quarter or two, we started seeing the 176-layer pilot production start-up. That was anticipated though, but we're starting to see some of that kind of pick up, but no real -- no real major capacity adds yet in NAND and NAND is still a little bit kind of like the last cylinder [Phonetic] to kind of really, really go forward with capacity.

DRAM is kind of moving along as we expected after the price has stabilized, after the utilization of the fabs, existing fabs went up. We started to see DRAM capacity, especially in Korea and in Xian, some areas we've started DRAM capacity adds start to roll in which we also anticipated. So -- I mean, those things are happening, but I think that was kind of how we saw the year rolling out.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Okay. The only reason I ask is, some of our checks have suggested that NAND utilization rates have immediately improved since December. And so, it appears that that improvement has not yet led to any dialog that you're hearing regarding increased wafer starts you got. Is that fair?

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

That's correct. Yeah, the first indicator of those utilization rate is going up, yeah. The next step is typically then discussions around -- plans around the capacity adds and that's still -- we haven't seen that taking place yet.

Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great. No other questions. Thanks, guys.

Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Christian.

Showing no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.

Notably, Ultra Clean’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 30.8%.



Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.

Factors to Consider

Ultra Clean’s first-quarter performance is anticipated to have benefited from its robust portfolio of diverse offerings that has positioned it well to capitalize on the growing demand for technology that supports 5G wireless, high-performance cloud computing, IoT and AI.



Steady demand for the company’s semiconductor products and services, led by solid traction in the semiconductor market, is likely to have been a key growth driver.



With an increase in wafer fabrication equipment investment, the company’s cleaning and analytical services are likely to have become more critical to its integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and original equipment manufacturer customers to support the production of leading next-gen devices. This is likely to have aided customer acquisition in the to-be-reported quarter.



Moreover, continued strength in foundry spending is expected to have driven top-line growth.

What Our Model Says

Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.



Ultra Clean has an Earnings ESP of -2.02% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 currently. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Stocks to Consider

HAYWARD, Calif., April 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UCTT), today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 26, 2021.

"Accelerating semiconductor demand, together with UCT's ability to execute on a global scale, resulted in another very robust quarter for the company," said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. "We have strong momentum across the company as our broad portfolio of products and services, including Ham-Let, makes us increasingly relevant and strategic to the success of our customers. Demand for semiconductors has never been higher and we will continue to invest in ways that position UCT to play a larger, more pivotal role in the industry's future."

Total gross margin was 20.8%, operating margin was 9.7%, and net income was $25.0 million or $0.62 and $0.60 per basic and diluted share.

First Quarter 2021 Non-GAAP Financial Results

Additional information is available at www.uct.com.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results are included at the end of this press release.

The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, certain insurance proceeds, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

A reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the subsequent quarter is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 5.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $55.65 in the previous session. Ultra Clean Holdings has gained 63.3% since the start of the year compared to the 5.1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 20.8% return for the Zacks Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery industry.

What's Driving the Outperformance?

The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 17, 2021, Ultra Clean reported EPS of $0.81 versus consensus estimate of $0.7.

For the current fiscal year, Ultra Clean is expected to post earnings of $3.39 per share on $1.65 billion in revenues. This represents a 21.07% change in EPS on a 18.01% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.75 per share on $1.9 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12% and 15.21%, respectively.

Valuation Metrics

Ultra Clean may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.

On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.

Ultra Clean has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.

In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.9X versus its peer group's average of 24.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.

Story continues

Zacks Rank

We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ultra Clean currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.

Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ultra Clean fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ultra Clean shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.

How Does Ultra Clean Stack Up to the Competition?

Shares of Ultra Clean have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Kulicke and Soffa Industries (KLIC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Waters (WAT), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.

The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Ultra Clean, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This release and the accompanying tables include a discussion of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for UCT and Ham-Let, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income (loss) plus provision for (benefit from) taxes, interest and other expense (income), depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and other infrequent or unusual items.

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in this press release may not be comparable to the definitions as reported by other companies.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful information because it provides UCT and investors with additional measurements to analyze past operating performance and enterprise value. The unaudited Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of income in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had UCT and Ham-Let been a combined company during the specified period.

A reconciliation of Net income to pro forma-adjusted EBITDA is provided in the accompanying table.

Words such as "anticipates,", "projection", "forecast", "believes," "plan," "expect," "future,"' "intends," "may," "will," "should," "estimates," "predicts," and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this press release include, without limitation, future financial and operating results, and benefits of the transaction and future opportunities for the combined company. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: (1) the ability of UCT to successfully integrate Ham-Let's operations and employees; (2) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (3) UCT's ability to successfully grow its or Ham-Let's business; (4) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the completion of the transaction; (5) the retention of key employees, customers or suppliers; and (6) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry markets overall or the economy in general. These risks and other factors also include, among others, those identified in "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in UCT's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Zacks Investment ResearchHAYWARD, Calif., Dec. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UCTT), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Ham-Let (Israel-Canada) Ltd. ("Ham-Let"), a public company listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, for approximately $348 million, which includes $287 million of equity value plus $61 million of net debt. Ham-Let is a global leader in the development, manufacturing and distribution of Ultra-High Purity and industrial flow control systems – valves, fittings, hoses and connectors largely used for the manufacturing of today's most complex semiconductor devices.

"Today's acquisition is another meaningful step in the execution of our long-term strategy to grow and diversify our business by adding complementary, high value, high margin product offerings to our growing portfolio of capabilities," said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. "Upon completion of this acquisition, UCT will be able to offer our existing semiconductor equipment customers a stronger and even broader set of offerings. UCT will also gain access to a new set of customers in the semiconductor fab infrastructure and sub-fab market, which represents an excellent platform for growth."

"This transaction represents a significant benefit to Ham-Let, its employees, its customers and its shareholders," added Amir Widmann, CEO of Ham-Let. "By leveraging UCT's global footprint, we can deliver a broader range of solutions and increase the combined company's strategic relevance to its customers. We look forward to working closely with UCT to ensure a smooth transition."

Under the terms of the agreement, the total transaction value is approximately $348 million and is being structured as an all-cash transaction. UCT has secured a committed debt financing through Barclays to fund the acquisition and repay Ham-Let's indebtedness. Concurrently, UCT is reviewing its overall capital structure to ensure the maintenance of a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.

UCT anticipates the acquisition to be accretive to shareholders on an adjusted basis within the first year after close.

Key Strategic and Financial Benefits

Expands Served Markets: The transaction broadens UCT's semiconductor SAM by more than $2 billion and provides access to a new set of customers in the semiconductor fab infrastructure and sub-fab market. Additionally, Ham-Let has current relationships with many Original Equipment Makers ("OEM") and Integrated Device Manufacturers ("IDM") customers and is currently a supplier to UCT.

Vertical Integration: Adding Ham-Let's offerings increases UCT's suite of capabilities, strengthening the company's leading market position and competitive edge. Ham-Let's high value, high purity components address a critical need increasingly demanded by leading OEM's and IDM's. The strength of UCT's sales channel to OEM's provides an opportunity for share gain.

Increased Shareholder Value/Synergies: The acquisition is expected to drive long-term shareholder value through cost and revenue synergy opportunities. Annual cost synergies will be driven primarily from elimination of duplicate public company costs, elimination/combination of redundant facilities, operational efficiencies and other general administration areas. Preliminary estimates for cost savings are approximately $20 million, and will be realized incrementally over the next three years. UCT expects additional potential upside from revenue synergies created by capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments. A table showing GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found at the end of this press release.

This release and the accompanying tables include a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as net income (loss) plus provision for (benefit from) taxes, interest expense, other expense (income), depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, and other infrequent or unusual items. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in this press release may not be comparable to the definitions as reported by other companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful information because it provides investors with additional measurements to analyze past operating performance and enterprise value. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided in the accompanying table.

Safe Harbor Statement

This press release contains, or may be deemed to contain, "forward-looking statements" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as "anticipates," "projection," "outlook," "forecast," "believes," "plan," "expect," "future," "intends," "may," "will," "estimates," "see," "predicts," "should" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements.

Forward looking statements included in this press release include, without limitation, statements regarding the proposed acquisition of Ham-Let by UCT, the expected timetable for completing the transaction, and benefits of the transaction and future opportunities for the combined company. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: (1) the ability to consummate the transaction and/or the financing for the transaction, (2) the financing used to consummate the transaction, (3) risks that the conditions to the closing of the transaction or the financing of the transaction are not satisfied, including the risk that required approvals for the transaction from governmental authorities are not obtained; (4) the ability of UCT to successfully integrate Ham-Let's operations and employees; (5) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (6) UCT's ability to successfully grow its or Ham-Let's business; (7) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; (8) the retention of key employees, customers or suppliers; and (9) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry markets overall and the economy in general as well. These risks and other factors also include, among others, those identified in "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in UCT's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.Ultra Clean, featured in today's IBD 50 Stocks To Watch, is getting close to a buy point as earnings and sales continue to rebound after a slump.

X

Chip-gear makers are rallying as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in a shortage of chips. The chip equipment group jumped to No. 34 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, from No. 58 three weeks ago.

Hayward, Calif.-based Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) makes planarization systems that smooth each layer of a silicon disk. Other industries also use its gear.

As the chip industry rebounds, Ultra Clean on April 28 reported Q1 earnings and sales that beat Wall Street targets. Earnings surged 77% to 92 cents a share on a 30% sales increase to $417.6 million.

That marked the sixth straight quarter of 73% or higher EPS, after six quarters of declines. Double-digit sales growth has resumed after six soft quarters.

Stocks To Watch: 'An Expedited Recovery'

"The buildup of digital infrastructure that accelerated last year because of the pandemic along with an expedited recovery in the need for semiconductors is fueling overall growth," CEO Jim Scholhamer said on the earnings call. "This has resulted in a considerable increase in productivity for our customers across all market segments, compared to just three months ago."

After the earnings report, D.A. Davidson reiterated a buy rating on Ultra Clean and raised its price target to 75 from 70.

"We are raising our 2021 and 2022 estimates (that we just published a few weeks ago) to reflect continued end-market momentum, ... our expectations that UCTT will continue its long history of outpacing the market and new expectations for strong growth of the Ham-Let product line," D.A. Davidson said in a client note.

IBD Stock Checkup assigns Ultra Clean a 96 Composite Rating, which gives investors a quick way to gauge a stock's key growth traits. That puts it among stocks to watch in the 31-stock chip equipment group, which includes Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML (ASML).

A 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, part of the overall Composite score, is third best in the group. It reflects a 46% five-year compound earnings growth rate. Analysts expect EPS to rise 39% this year and 13% the next.

Top 7% Of All Stocks

A 93 Relative Strength Rating means the chip-gear maker is beating 93% of all other stocks. Its relative strength line, which compares a stock's performance to the S&P 500, is off highs but turning slightly higher. A move to new highs at or ahead of a potential breakout would be a bullish sign.

Shares surged 454% from their March 2020 pandemic low to their early April high. Ultra Clean is now working on the right side of a cup base with a 65.43 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis. It's about 13% away from the entry.

The base is second stage, so the stock has more room to run. Leading stocks tend to make their biggest advance out of such early stage bases.

See Stocks On The List Of Market Leaders With IBD LeaderboardThe market expects Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This chipmaking equipment services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $507.61 million, up 47.2% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ultra Clean?

For Ultra Clean, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ultra Clean will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ultra Clean would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +10.84%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Ultra Clean doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Time to Invest in Legal Marijuana

If you’re looking for big gains, there couldn’t be a better time to get in on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion back in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.

After a clean sweep of 6 election referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 states plus D.C. Federal legalization is expected soon and that could be a still greater bonanza for investors. Even before the latest wave of legalization, Zacks Investment Research has recommended pot stocks that have shot up as high as +285.9%.

You’re invited to check out Zacks’ Marijuana Moneymakers: An Investor’s Guide. It features a timely Watch List of pot stocks and ETFs with exceptional growth potential.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.

Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.

On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the "Value" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and "A" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.

One stock to keep an eye on is Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT). UCTT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.93. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.70. Over the past year, UCTT's Forward P/E has been as high as 24.71 and as low as 6.56, with a median of 15.11.

UCTT is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.99. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UCTT's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.71. Over the last 12 months, UCTT's PEG has been as high as 2.52 and as low as 0.47, with a median of 1.20.

Investors should also recognize that UCTT has a P/B ratio of 1.62. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. UCTT's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.31. Over the past year, UCTT's P/B has been as high as 2.55 and as low as 1.09, with a median of 1.90.

Story continues

Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UCTT has a P/S ratio of 0.64. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.48.

Finally, we should also recognize that UCTT has a P/CF ratio of 12.03. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. UCTT's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 14.29. Over the past year, UCTT's P/CF has been as high as 30.68 and as low as 11.87, with a median of 19.28.

Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Ultra Clean Holdings is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UCTT sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.

Zacks Investment ResearchMotley Fool

Shares of ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) are up a solid 14% in 11 a.m. EDT trading Monday after the semiconductor manufacturer crushed analyst expectations for Q2 earnings -- and didn't do half bad on sales, either. Expected to report a $0.49 pro forma profit on $1.62 billion in sales in fiscal Q2 2022, ON Semiconductor instead posted earnings of $0.63 per share on sales of $1.67 billion this morning. Actual earnings when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were only $0.42 per share -- but even this was a big improvement over Q2 last year, when ON Semiconductor broke even.Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) is a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) that is a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment, flat panel, solar and medical device industries. The company customers are mostly manufacturers in the semiconductor equipment space, which gives the investors in UCTT exposure to tech.

About the Company

Ultra Clean was founded in 1991 and has almost 4,000 full time employees. It is headquartered in California, in the Silicon Valley region.

The company has a market cap of about $800 million and has Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value and “B” in growth. The Forward PE is just over 8, making the stock a value candidate.

Q4 Earnings

Ultra Clean reported Q2 EPS in late July, posting a 66% EPS surprise to the upside. Revenues were up to $344.8M v the $265M in the prior year. The company also guided Q3 EPS higher, now seeing a range of $0.56-0.72 v the $0.23 expected. Revenues look to improve and were guided higher to $320-360M v the $278 expected.

The beat was the sixth straight and the biggest surprise beat the company has ever seen. The quarter was well received, with the stock jumping over 20% after earnings were released.

Estimates

Analysts have been hiking their numbers since the company reported and gave guidance. Over the last 60 days, estimates have jumped 333% for next quarter, from $0.12 to $0.52. For the current year, estimates have gone higher by 67% over the same time frame.

A couple upgrades of note since earnings. First coming from Stifel, who rates UCTT as a hold, but raised their price target to $26 from $23.

Needham has the stock at a Buy, and after earnings raised their targets to $35 from $26.

Is it time to buy after the big sell off?

The stock gapped higher after earnings, printing a 2020 high of $31.10. The stock is down over 35% since those tops, falling after the gap was filled and moving averages were broken. Recent issues with Intel could be hurting the stock with news of delays in manufacturing. Investors have a right to be nervous, but considering the valuation and recent earnings, the sell-off looks to be overdone.

Story continues

Technicals

Earnings caused a massive spike higher, but since the gap was filled the stock has been bleeding lower. The stock has now fallen into a 61.8% retracement level drawn from March lows to recent highs. This could be a big area for the bulls to step in, so investors should watch for a reaction around the $19.50 area.

If that area holds, the bulls would need to take back the 200-day MA at $21.75. Another area of resistance on a bull run would $25, with longer term traders targeting $35.

Bottom Line

The sell off is overdone and investors looking to buy should confirm support in the $19.50 area. While there might be fundamental issues coming from Intel, the company has long-term growth prospects at great value.

SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.HAYWARD, Calif., Feb. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UCTT), today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 25, 2020.

"UCT delivered another solid quarter to conclude an extraordinary year where we reached many new milestones, including record revenue and earnings per share, marking the fifth straight year we significantly outperformed the overall wafer fab equipment industry," said Jim Scholhamer, CEO. "Industry demand remains robust and we continue to position ourselves for new opportunities. We are excited about our acquisition of Hamlet and expect to close the transaction by early Q2 of 2021".

Fourth Quarter 2020 GAAP Financial Results

Total revenue was $369.6 million. SPS contributed $299.5 million and SSB added $70.1 million. Total gross margin was 21.0%, operating margin was 9.0%, and net income was $22.6 million or $0.56 and $0.55 per basic and diluted share. This compares to total revenue of $363.3 million, gross margin of 20.5%, operating margin of 9.6%, and net income of $24.4 million or $0.60 and $0.59 per basic and diluted share in the prior quarter.

Fourth Quarter 2020 Non-GAAP Financial Results

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 21.5%, operating margin was 11.9%, and net income was $33.5 million or $0.81 per diluted share. This compares to gross margin of 21.0%, operating margin of 11.6%, and net income of $29.9 million or $0.73 per diluted share in the prior quarter.

Full Year 2020 GAAP Financial Results

Total revenue was $1,398.6 million. SPS contributed $1,131.2 million and SSB added $267.4 million. Total gross margin was 20.9%, operating margin was 8.7%, and net income was $77.6 million or $1.93 and $1.89 per basic and diluted share.

First Quarter 2021 Outlook

Due to limited visibility resulting from the pandemic, the Company has widened its guidance ranges to reflect the heightened uncertainty in the marketplace.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables presenting reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results are included at the end of this press release.

The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

A reconciliation of our guidance for non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the following quarter is not available due to fluctuations in the geographic mix of our earnings from quarter to quarter, which impacts our tax rate and cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and we are unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Safe Harbor Statement

The foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, "forward-looking statements" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. We use words such as "anticipates," "projection," "outlook," "forecast," "believes," "plan," "expect," "future," "intends," "may," "will," "estimates," "see," "predicts," "should" and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements included in this press release include our expectations about the semiconductor capital equipment market and outlook. All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors also include, among others, those identified in "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2019 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise unless required by law.

Some shares have withstood the economic shockwaves caused by Covid-19 better than others - but is Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NSQ:UCTT) one of them?

To understand why different shares respond to chaos in different ways, it pays to look at their strengths. In bull markets, investors gravitate to speculative, unproven growth stocks as a means of achieving the best returns. But these stocks usually collapse first in a crisis.

By contrast, high quality shares often get overlooked in bull markets. But it's these stocks that are often better at keeping their momentum and recovering quickest from periods of volatility.



Shares in Ultra Clean Holdings Inc are currently trading at 42.47 but a question in the minds of many investors is how the price will respond to the Covid-19 uncertainty.

The answer is that there are some positive signs. The stock scores well against some important financial and technical measures and has exposure to two influential drivers of investment returns: high quality and strong momentum.



So why are these two factors important and where are the clues hidden?

GET MORE DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS INTO NSQ:UCTT »

High quality

When it comes to stock analysis, company quality tends to show up in high profitability and strong industry-leading margins. These kinds of firms are stable, growing and often have accelerating sales and earnings. They also have strong and improving financial histories with no signs of accountancy or bankruptcy risk.

One of the quality metrics for Ultra Clean Holdings Inc is its 5-year Return on Capital Employed, which is 11.5%. Good, double-digit ROCEs are a pointer to companies that can grow very profitably.

Strong momentum

Positive momentum trends show up in share prices and earnings growth. You can find the clues in stocks that are trading close to their 52 week high prices and outperforming the market. They’ll often be beating broker estimates and getting forecast upgrades and recommendation changes.

This is true at Ultra Clean Holdings Inc, where the share price has seen a 70.5% return relative to the market over the past 12 months. Market volatility and economic uncertainty can be a major drag on momentum, but previously strong stocks can be quick to recover when confidence returns.



In summary, good quality and momentum are pointers to some of the best stocks on the strongest uptrends. This combination of factors can be a clue to finding shares that can deliver solid investment profits over many years.

In good times, these shares can become expensive to buy. But in volatile markets, there may be chances to buy them at cheaper prices.What happened

Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings (NASDAQ:UCTT) popped on Thursday after the company reported revenue growth and profits exceeding expectations. The stock was up 23% as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, and is now beating the market in 2020.

Beating the market is what this sleepy semiconductor company has done over the past five years. Ultra Clean Holdings was ranked No. 11 on Fortune's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies in 2018, a list that looks back three years, acknowledging its outperformance.

So what

There are many layers to the semiconductor industry, including manufacturing. Ultra Clean Holdings provides critical subsystems (parts) to semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies like Lam Research and Applied Materials. These subsystems, as the company's name implies, help keep everything clean -- crucial when manufacturing sensitive microchips.

Ultra Clean Holdings has operations in China and was negatively impacted by the coronavirus in the first quarter. At the time, the company provided second-quarter revenue guidance of $290 million to $330 million, and earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $0.40 to $0.56. However, Q2 revenue exceeded guidance; it generated $345 million. And EPS was toward the high end of guidance at $0.52 per diluted share.

Ultra Clean Holdings benefited from a quick recovery in manufacturing after an initial coronavirus shutdown.

Now what

Next quarter, Ultra Clean Holdings expects to generate revenue between $320 million and $360 million and EPS between $0.56 and $0.72. Those are wide ranges, and reflect the ongoing uncertainty from COVID-19. However, even the low end of guidance reflects a marked improvement from the third quarter of last year. In Q3 of 2019, it reported revenue of $254 million and EPS of $0.01.

Ultra Clean Holdings shareholders should be aware of a risk that isn't unique among critical subsystem companies. A full 67% of the company's revenue comes from just two customers: Lam Research and Applied Materials. Granted, these are enormous customers that account for a lot of market share, and it's not as dependent on them now as in years past. However, losing either customer to a competitor would be devastating.

But that doesn't appear to be an imminent possibility. In fact, Ultra Clean Holdings is expanding. Along with today's earnings release, the company announced it's expanding into Malaysia. This facility could increase its overall capacity by 50% in the long run and places it in close proximity to customers. The move bodes well for Ultra Clean Holdings' future prospects.Here are five stocks added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) List today:

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Story continues

The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

The foregoing information contains, or may be deemed to contain, "forward-looking statements" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

Forward looking statements included in this press release include our expectations about the semiconductor capital equipment market and outlook.

SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.Today's IBD Screen Of The Day column focuses on growth stocks on our Weekly Review screen, a screen of industry group leaders with Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings of 85 or higher. It's one of several powerful screens found in the IBD Stock Screener.

X

Among the many stocks currently on the list, the ones with best charts include Regions Financial (RF), chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT), Fox Factory (FOXF), Hilltop Holdings (HTH) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT). These stocks come from a variety of sectors and industry groups.

Top Growth Stocks: Analyzing Fox Factory

Fox Factory, maker of products used on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles, is forming a flat base, according to MarketSmith analysis, with a buy point of 166.98. Shares remain roughly 8% away from the buy area. The base is forming entirely above its 50-day moving average, which is a positive sign.

The base is part of a base-on-base formation, sitting atop a prior base with a buy point at 144.35.

The relative strength line of Fox Factory has been moving sideways since late April. This compares a stock's performance with that of the S&P 500. Yet Fox Factory still holds a year-to-date gain of about 45% in 2021, far outperforming the major indexes.

The Georgia-based company maintains a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99. The company's year-over-year EPS growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, from 29% to 38% to 102% in the most recent quarter. This well exceeds IBD's CAN SLIM requirements for top growth stocks.

The growth stock ranks No. 1 in its industry group by Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group itself ranks a strong No. 35 out of the 197 groups IBD measures.

Two Regional Banks In Buy Zones

Regions Financial has had a strong 2021 as well, rising about 45% year to date. The stock has been trading above the 50-day line since late April. The regional bank, which operates over 1,300 offices throughout 15 states in the South and Midwest, is trading inside the buy zone of a 22.71 buy point in a nine-week consolidation.

The relative strength line is near its recent highs. The company also maintains a Relative Strength Rating of 87, which is above the minimum of 80 on a scale of 1 to 99.

Regions Financial, which is in IBD Leaderboard, has a near-perfect Composite Rating of 98. In the two most recent quarters, earnings surged 55% and 320% year over year.

Fellow regional bank stock Hilltop Holdings is also among top stocks to watch. Shares are trading inside the buy range of a cup-with-handle base with a 37.18 buy point. The stock broke out late last week after gaining support at the 50-day line. But breakout volume was mediocre.

Hilltop Holdings is a holding company for PlainsCapital Bank, which serves clients in Texas through over 60 offices.

Top Chip Equipment Makers: Applied Materials, Ultra Clean Holdings

Applied Materials stock is trading near the upper edge of a consolidation with a 146.10 buy point. Shares remain roughly 5% away from the buy point.

The stock's RS line has been choppy but improved the past couple of weeks and has been moving sharply higher since the start of May.

Applied Materials has a strong Composite Rating of 97. In the past two quarters, the company saw the bottom line rise 42% and 83% year over year, respectively. According to IBD data, the company is expected to show earnings growing 67% in the July-ending quarter.

Applied Materials boasts 10 straight quarters of increasing fund ownership. Doing well in this metric is key for top growth stocks.

Another chip equipment maker on IBD's Weekly Review screen is Ultra Clean Holdings, which has risen 80% year to date. Shares are building a cup base with 65.43 buy point and remain roughly 14% away from the proper entry.

Global Credit Research - 17 Dec 2020

New York, December 17, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service said Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (Ultra Clean) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Ham-Let (Israel-Canada) Ltd. (Ham-Let), a public company listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, for total transaction value of approximately $348 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions. Ultra Clean has secured a debt financing commitment to fund the acquisition. Concurrently with the acquisition, Ultra Clean has announced that it is reviewing its overall capital structure to ensure the maintenance of a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Pending this review and a determination of the final capital structure after the acquisition, the transaction has no immediate effect on the company's Corporate Family Rating of B1, senior secured bank credit facility rating of B1, or the stable outlook.

Ham-Let is a global leader in the development, manufacturing and distribution of ultra-high Purity and industrial flow control systems, including valves, fittings, hoses and connectors largely used for the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Ham-Let is current a supplier to Ultra Clean which presents a vertical integration opportunity. Ham-Let is also a supplier to Ultra Clean's largest semiconductor capital equipment customers, and the acquisition expands and deepens Ultra Clean's strategic customer relationships. In addition, Ham-Let provides access to an incremental group of customers in the semiconductor fab infrastructure and sub-fab market. The transaction presents a meaningful cost synergy opportunity relative to its size.
