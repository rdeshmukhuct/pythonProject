Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Ultra Clean Technology Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us.
For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda and good afternoon, everyone.
By maximizing our current market position and capabilities and consistently working to meet customer demand, UCT again reached new revenue and EPS milestones.
Total revenue for the second quarter was just over $515 million, a 50% increase year-over-year and EPS grew 32% to nearly $1.
This track record combined with our commitment to investing in our future paves the way for a very exciting roadmap for growth in 2021 and beyond.
As the semiconductor industry continues to be stretched by record high demand, we are leveraging our leading position as a partner of choice to help our customers and their customers accelerate the rapid migration toward next generation devices.
The global semiconductor industry has historically been driven by demand from electronics such as smart phones and computers.
More recently, continued enhancement of existing products and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as AI, 5G networks and high performance computing applications are creating sustained demand increases across a much broader end market.
This megatrend is enabling greater visibility with multi-year record breaking industry capex plans for leading and trailing edge capacity to support the extent of that [Phonetic].
UCT's broad spectrum of products and services are increasingly relevant to the success of our customers and this gives us a significant competitive advantage.
We are one of the few semiconductor focused manufacturers with the proven ability to sustainably support the dynamic product roadmaps and stringent quality levels required for advanced chip manufacturing.
To ensure we are ideally positioned to deliver value quickly and efficiently to our customers worldwide, we are making strategic investments to expand our capacity to provide additional leading edge and specialty capabilities to support our growth strategy over the long term.
Our new state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia is on schedule and customer qualifications are beginning this month.
Fortunately, we are located at Northern Malaysia where COVID cases remained low compared to the rest of the country.
We remain on track to start initial production in early September and expect to progressively ramp this year and into 2022 to meet our customers' increasing needs.
The timing of this additional capacity is a deal as it strategically expands our capabilities on existing and new customer platform and an optimal time.
Our product capacity expansion program stretches beyond Malaysia and include strategic investments designed to capture that many significant profitable growth opportunities we see.
Not only a wafer fab production equipment, but also in service, sub-fab [Phonetic] support equipment and fab infrastructure as well as the industry continues to transform at a very rapid pace.
We will continue to engage with our customers to design, manufacture and service the best products in the best way possible to address their needs in a sustainable manner.
The global pandemic continues to be a risk factor as the Delta variant is spreading quickly across many regions.
Our growing suite of capabilities, additional capacity, strong balance sheet ideally positions us to capitalize on the robust demand trends returning considerable value to our shareholders over the long term.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone.
Thanks for joining us.
Our Products division was up 28% to $442.5 million, which includes nearly a full quarter of revenue from Ham-Let amounting to $58.2 million.
Total gross margin for the second quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.2% compared to 21.3% last quarter.
Margins can be influenced by customer concentration, geography, product mix and volumes, sure [Phonetic] there will be variances quarter-to-quarter.
Total operating margin for the quarter was 11.7% compared to 12.2% in the first quarter.
Based on 44.3 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.99 on net income of $43.7 million compared to $0.92 on net income of $38.2 million in the prior quarter.
We expect our tax rate for 2021 to stay in the high teens.
A significant portion of the increase was a result of the equity offering in April, 2021.
We have recast our arrangement to purchase additional shares of the JV to remain much more flexible.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question.
First one for Jim on Sheri.
Just a quick housekeeping question.
How much is Ham-Let in your September guidance?
Okay, fair enough.
Thanks, Sheri for that.
We certainly are not forecasting out through December or through the March quarter.
But I think it's safe to say that all throughout the industry, we see a pretty solid forecast out through the end of the year and into next year.
At this point, it's really a case for the whole industry more gated by the ability to really produce the WFE tools rather than orders, orders on hand.
So I think we see an unusually long trail of orders heading out several quarters which normally we don't see.
I just want to check on the operating leverage, clearly revenue has increased in June, but margins were kind of flattish, and then kind of the guidance based on September, it looks like revenue is improving but EPS is kind of still not that much.
So is Ham-Let unique [Phonetic] or do you think that incremental operating leverage kind of waning now that the easy moves up.
We anticipate that we'll be able to get them into our products range of 8% to 10% in the next couple of quarters.
So that's really the one of the key contributors as well as we have to continue to add specific [Technical Issues] so that we can continue to grow, so that we will continue to work on that as we have look forward.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks, Sheri.
Thanks, Jim.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Welcome.
And do you feel that your business is constrained through your manufacturing footprint or do you think you should be able to meet demand based on your manufacturing capacity today?
Thanks, Quinn.
I think overall, we're doing a pretty good job of keeping up with demand and making the deliveries that we're expected to make.
It's more a case of the ability of the whole industry to really absorb the other parts.
If we make a module on time or we make a tool on time, there's other elements to that have to also be ready.
So I think it's really a case where the whole industry, our customers and our peers are also kind of hand in the mouth right now.
So even when we're able to make deliveries, we're a little bit constrained when the whole -- the whole tool is ready to go, if you would.
So, but I think we're doing, we're doing a pretty good job and keeping up.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, thanks for that question.
Demand is really strong across the board for Ham-Let we're definitely making progress with all the engineering and drawings changes needed to really set that up, the book to bill in that business is really high right now.
And so that work where we're doing the qualifications and getting in place is really setting us up for next year and I think at this point, we're doing everything we can be kind of increase the capacity of Ham-Let to just to meet the orders on hand is definitely, I'd say around the time that we closed on the business we saw orders really spiked up pretty dramatically in that space.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

That's great.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, absolutely.
This was something that was put in place by quantum clean QuantumClean before we purchased them.
As a result, we were able to consolidate profits up 86%.
And we still own a majority of the JV, greater than 50% and really what it allows us to do is it gives us as, as we continue to look at M&A is core to our strategy, it really allows us to maintain flexibility with our capital.
So that is more beneficial to shareholders.
And if we decide we want to buy up to that amount we will, but it just gives us more optionality versus obligation.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

So, will you just effectively be recording a higher minority interest so that you historically had 86% of that JV flowing through your income statement, and now that it's, you don't have the obligation, you'll have a lower than 86% of profits effectively flowing through the income statement.
So you'll see a little bit larger back out a profit in the other income and interest line and that's what the effective three to four senses.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

You're welcome.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook.
Jim maybe to follow-up on -- for the capacity constraint question, I look at it from a different angle of supply constraints, based on your results and outlook, it looks like you manage that very well.
One, did you experience any, I guess, meaningful supply constraints.
And secondly, if not, what have you've been doing differently or have you been able to procure the necessary supply to keep up with your customers' end demand?
Thanks, Patrick.
We've definitely had some level of constraint happening from some of the kind of build -- built-in OPMs, we call them original part manufacturers, so that definitely throttled back our ability.
We could have delivered more revenue.
But we could have delivered more if we had been able to secure more of some of those OPM parts.
And some of our competitors were that we were able to pick up some additional business within this quarter and probably this quarter a little bit as well.
Overall, I would say we've been able to meet the customers' needs.
But because of some of those constrictions we were, capably were constrained on delivering the amount of revenue.
We could have delivered more revenue in this quarter without those issues.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great, that's helpful.
But given the -- I guess the high demand that we're seeing out there, am I right to assume that you could absorb that capacity faster and I guess, the normal time start-up cost could be a little bit less and you can get gross margins or I guess you can keep gross margins at these elevated levels because of the high demand.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I do think that we are able to absorb the majority of those costs.
Malaysia is going to really be something that's probably more impactful to 2022.
But I think as we slowly started up, I don't see there being a huge, huge drag on our margin as a result of that.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great, thank you very much.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hey guys, congrats on another good quarter and outlook.
Can you help us understand what the -- remind us probably, how much revenue you could get from the Malaysian facility in '22 and it would it be running at full capacity by the end of '22 or do you think it would take longer?
Yeah, the full capacity when it's all built out in two to three years, the maximum is roughly around $600 million in revenue.
There's always some legal room in there as well.
But roughly a third of that is available, will be -- is available right now and we expect to have that kind of build out by the end of the next year.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
And given kind of the tightness in the strength of the wafer front-end equipment market integral [Phonetic] are you already securing orders for your September production and end of '22 for that facility as we sit here today.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, one of the phenomena that we're seeing is a lot more working together with our customers to secure long lead time deals from them, which therefore we are able to cover that -- cover those deals back to our supply chain.
So we're getting a lot of great cooperation from our customers to really put the money down and put the orders in and work, then we're able to lay out long-term orders with the supply chain.
So I think we're in good shape.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, definitely, absolutely, I mean, obviously this year, if you look at the inorganic, the acquisition of Ham-Let, that kind of puts us already in that in that territory.
And then on top of that, we're doing very well with the organic side of our growth equation, which is share gain, continued outsourcing that we're seeing from our customers, continued penetration of little, deliver space where we're heavily engaged.
So I think I am very confident that this year we will do -- we will easily hit the 10 points and hopefully much beyond that.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
No other questions.
Thanks, guys.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
So Jim, can you give us your views on WFE and wafer starts kind of the second half of this year and maybe some commentary on next year?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think WFE, I think a lot of the prognosis is, I think we're in pretty, pretty much the same boat as our customers.
I think we kind of see that there.
Wafer starts are a little bit slower, just because the fab they're running full out, so there's is no utilization to really soak up, so the wafer starts are growing as the equipment goes in.
So we're seeing wafer starts growth, but it's really at this point a little bit tapped out due to I think every single fab that we know is running at full capacity.
So I think I think we're in pretty much lockstep with what the big OEMs like a pioneer what you're saying I think which is roughly $80 million to $85 million.
And I think also, they're are also predicting a pretty strong 2022 as well.
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay.
How much revenue was pushed out of the quarter with the constraints that you saw?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean I think I wouldn't say pushed out, but I would definitely term it, we probably could have done another $20 million, $30 million or so, but I think many companies have the same story.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

I think one of the things that we're still trying -- still seeing is, freight cost being quite high, I think a lot of companies are seeing that as being kind of one of those expenses that have come in higher than we had pre-COVID.
So I would say that that's something that I would anticipate probably being ongoing, but I think the margin still did very well despite having such expenses flow through.
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Sure.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Dick.
And we really look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Thank you very much.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Ultra Clean First Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda, and good afternoon everyone.
UCT again delivered record revenue growth, above expectations for the first quarter driven by solid execution on higher-than-expected demand across both our products and services markets.
I sincerely thank the thousands of employees around the world who collectively pulled together to anticipate, commit and deliver the best possible results for our customers, our company and our shareholders.
By making important continuous investments in our people, our facilities, our products and our services, we have grown our revenue by 30% and our earnings by 70% year-over-year.
Because our strategic investments in our businesses are closely aligned with the needs of our customers, I am more confident than ever that we are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term increase in industry demand.
This has resulted in a considerable increase in productivity for our customers across all market segments, compared to just three months ago.
Our customers and their customers are making significant investments in response to projected strong multi-year growth due to secular trends such as 5G, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
These investments have effectively reset equipment spending expectations to a much higher level for the foreseeable future.
One of our most important accomplishments this past quarter was the closing of the Ham-Let acquisition.
The addition of Ham-Let's high purity flow control systems, means we can now offer our customers a more diversified set of product offerings.
This enables us to play an increasingly important and pivotal role in meeting our customers' needs from the design processes, all the way to the support and service maintenance requirements found in any high volume manufacturing fab.
And the timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better.
Ham-Let's gas delivery capabilities not only play an important role within the equipment space, but also within the sub-fab infrastructure build-out phase.
We plan to leverage existing relationships with our customers and see a clear opportunity to participate in the multi-year build-out of these foundry, logic and memory fabs.
UCT's new facility in Malaysia remains on track to begin production in the third quarter.
Hiring began earlier this year in many employees are already being trained.
We are uniquely positioned to support our customers and grow our share as outsourcing opportunity to gain momentum.
Another major achievement this quarter with the UCT was awarded Intel 2020 supplier Achievement Award for COVID-19 response.
I mentioned this last quarter, it's even more meaningful today, there is never been a better more opportune time to be the manufacturing leader in the semiconductor industry.
Our growing portfolio of product and service offerings together with our strong operational performance and resilient business model will drive continuous long-term growth and profitability with the goal of returning even more value to our shareholders.
The addition of Ham-Let share gain an unprecedented levels of demand all contributed toward substantial increase in revenue guidance for the second quarter.
Industry sentiment backed by our internal market analysis projects strong sustainable momentum and UCT is poised to continue to outperform through 2021 and beyond.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone.
Thanks for joining us.
Total gross margin for the first quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.3% compared to 21.5% last quarter.
Based on $41.6 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92 on net income of $38.2 million compared to $0.81 on net income of $33.5 million in the prior quarter.
We expect our tax rate for 2021 to stay in the high teens.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents were $264.3 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $200.3 million last quarter.
Cash from operations was very strong at $55.6 million, an increase of $21.2 million from the prior quarter.
In the first quarter, we refinanced our term loan to fund the Ham-Let acquisition.
The offering was approximately four times oversubscribed and resulted in a new Term B loan totaling $628 million at an interest rate of 375 plus LIBOR, compared to 450 plus LIBOR for the original loan.
We are very pleased with the strong investor interest and result in term of the new loan.
With the completion of our refinancing in our equity offering, we are well positioned to capitalize on expansion opportunities while maintaining an ideal level of operating leverage.
To continue to meet accelerated demand and including a full quarter of revenue from Ham-Let, we anticipate revenue for the second quarter to be between $490 million and $520 million, an increase of 21%, using the midpoint.
Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company.
Congratulations guys on the nice results and guidance.
If I've got my numbers right, is the core UCT business up 8% would be guided to roughly $450 million, and then the difference would be Ham-Let contribution?
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great.
You've talked about being able to grow faster than WFE in the industry, and I guess I'm wondering do you think the core SSP and SPS businesses are growing in line faster than WFE, if you were to exclude that Ham-Let acquisition?
Definitely on the SPS side, obviously we're seeing very strong growth quarter-on-quarter, and I think we expect to see that.
And we're really looking forward to our increased capacity coming out of Malaysia in the last half of the year, that really help with that.
As you know on the services side, the cleaning side that grows more along with wafer starts.
So we expect to see that grow more in line with the wafer start growth or hopefully slightly above that as we work through our programs.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great.
Do you think it's sort of flat with the higher first half?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

I'd say it's safe to say, we see no reason why it couldn't continue to grow throughout the year.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great.
All right.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Quinn.
Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Thank you very much.
And also, congrats on the really nice quarter and outlook.
Jim, maybe first off, you guys did a great job last year in terms of procuring supplies and meeting customer demand.
There are very challenging period with the pandemic.
And how are you keeping pace with a lot of your customers demand needs, because again the demand expectations have significantly risen in the short-term, and your results obviously indicate you're keeping pace with what your customers need.
Anything that you've learned from last year that you are applying this year, or are you just, just able to meet a lot of that I guess excess demand?
Yes, that's definitely --- you're absolutely right.
It's very constrained environment right now.
I think one of the big things and I think our customers also learn that it's really to take the projection and the commitment back as far as you can through the supply chain, through your suppliers and through your suppliers' suppliers, and really operate beyond a PO-to-PO kind of basis, and work more and a forecast, and a partnership kind basis with the suppliers.
So I think we've done a good job with that.
There is always more to do, but I think the industry has moved away from being transactional to being more of a partnership, all the way back to the supply chain.
Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Great, that's helpful.
And maybe as my follow-up question in terms of the new facility in Malaysia.
Patrick, you're right.
With the volumes that we're seeing, we're not seeing as much impact on the margins as we move through the year.
So I would kind of think about Malaysia and Singapore almost been a combined entity when we look at those cost, and those are actually assisting us with meeting the demand that we need.
So it's not putting as much pressure on had we not been in this situation from a volume perspective.
Patrick J. Ho -- Stifel Financial Corporation -- Analyst

Great.
Thank you again, and keep up the good work.
Good afternoon.
First, a couple of housekeeping for Sheri.
What is the new share count?
The new share count adds 3.2 million shares to our current account.
I can give you the exact numbers a little bit later, but that's the -- where we anticipate being.
Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay.
Great.
Just want to make sure, I mean, and then Jim, when you look at the Ham-Let business, does that -- do those products grow with WFE, and then I guess you would expect the customer response so far view controlling it, and what is the timing for getting more of their products into your gas pedal?
Thanks.
In the long-term, I think we see, like the two to three year period we see a lot of opportunity to make huge gains in the market share of the Ham-Let components in this space.
And so that's a percentage that is actually relatively high.
Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, we are seeing the semi-part so strong, that I would actually say the whole company is growing along with WFE or maybe ahead of that, but the non-semi part, it's kind of the case of like hits and hits and and other misses.
Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great.
Was that for the Clean business?
That for our response to COVID, which actually both sides of our business did a great job, but, yeah, that was in particular to our ability to really use our global footprint to really keep the Intel fabs moving and flowing.
When one factory would be hit by COVID, we are able to use our footprint to really move things around and be adaptive and flexible and we are very delighted to be recognized by Intel for that.
Davidson & Co. -- Analyst

Okay, great, thank you for your time.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hey, congratulations guys on a great quarter and solid outlook.
Going back to Malaysia, if we kind of look at Singapore and Malaysia as a combined basis.
Yeah, I think we're looking at Malaysia of adding $600 million to $800 million annually of more capacity, right now, it is a very symbiotic nature with Singapore as we move things back and forth as we're still finishing up the building right now.
So, we're utilizing some of the employees that we have hired for it with the Singapore operations to help deal with the high demand out there.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Fabulous.
So, if we look to the huge or stronger meaningful whatever adjective you want to use, multi-year CapEx spending environment by the world's largest spenders and your largest customers as that kicks in, in Q3 you should be very well positioned for that strength and potential market share gains.
Is that fair?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Absolutely.
And actually, we're seeing different projects that we're winning are actually going straight into Malaysia production as the initial production site, which is, which is highly unusual with the new production site.
So, I think the environment is so that new capacity coming on board right now is a very valuable commodity.
So, we're seeing a great reception from our customers to move product either from their own factories or from other sources to our new Malaysian sites.
So, we have pretty high expectations of our ability to use that, that new capacity coming online right, I would say, right in the nick of time.
And then you look at all the new fab builds in your opportunity with Ham-Let there as well as more equipment for Quantum to clean, it seems to me, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems to me that your ability to outgrow the market over the next 2 to 3 years could even be more meaningful than it has been in the last few years?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think that's a fair statement.
10% has been our average outgrowth of the market, but we certainly strive to do much more than that, especially with the acquisitions.
So, we are definitely looking at outpacing the market by at least 10% and obviously more if we can, and the addition of Malaysia sets us up really nicely for that.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
Great.
The first sort of a follow-up to Christian's question, just as you look at your share gains, how much is that being driven by the COVID supply chain tightness and OEMs being willing to sort of open up new second sources or additional sources of supply, whether that's in your core business or opportunities for Ham-Let?
Obviously, the capacity coming online right now, certainly -- it's certainly an opportune time for us.
And I think the majority of the impact is simply -- the demand is very strong for equipment and the ability for whoever can deliver right now.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Great.
And then the second question is, can you kind of walk us through the math.
How much of a margin boost do you think you could see?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

To the first question is, yes, it does exclude in-sourcing or internal transactions as far as the growth that we're seeing on the Ham-Let side.
Certainly, there is OEMs and their requirements as well as some of the chipmakers and there's a lot of new fab announcements as well as I think you've all seen and those fabs demand a lot of the same type of components that are used on the OEM equipment.
So, I think we're seeing pretty strong demand over the next several years across the board.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely Dick.
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay.
Can we expect any kind of operating model updates from you guys in the next coming quarters?
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay, good.
Wafer starts, I think the latest numbers there are coming out pretty quickly and often I think they are in the high single digits maybe the low double digits, we could look that up for you what our latest market forecast is.
That's good.
But with some of your major customers at the most leading edge of both the foundry logic, as well as the memory side of things.
And what I'm getting by that is again utilization is probably the biggest driver, but because yield is becoming so much more and more important at the most advanced nodes, that's driving, yeah, I guess, incremental needs for parts cleaning to ensure that the tools keep running at the highest throughputs and yields.
That's a good point, Patrick.
I think what we're also seeing -- you're right, at the advanced node, the parts cleaning this cycle seems to be more vigorous in order to keep the yields up.
But what we're also starting to see is advanced coatings are becoming a really important factor.
So there used to be a clean the part, you return it, now -- and there's always been certain coatings that are applied to the parts for certain reasons.
As we move down to 7 and to 5 and to 3 nanometer, we're starting to see specialty coatings and surface texturing becoming a more important player.
So not just not just cleaning the parts, but also applying these special coatings and texturing.
And so it's growing, I mean obviously it's a very small revenue overall, compared to overall cleaning at this point, but we're seeing the growth in that space is really kind of off the charts, and we think that's an area that's really going to take off in the next few years, which is really a lot more around cleaning plus, and that's where we have a great position and we're doing a lot of work with the leading IDMs in that space.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good afternoon and welcome to the Ultra Clean Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Conference Call.
Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us.
For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda, and good afternoon everyone.
For many reasons 2020 was unlike any year we've ever seen.
But by every measure, it was an extraordinary one for UCT.
I must start by thanking our global employees for their commitment, resiliency, determination and drive to be the best.
The team rose to the challenge and continued to exemplify our culture of integrity and teamwork producing some of the best financial results we have seen in our 30-year history.
While significantly outgrowing the overall WFE market by 11%, to reach these extraordinary milestones in a year for all the challenges, we continuously adjusted to the changing work environment while staying focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong return to shareholders.
Technology advancements within our data-driven economy continue to fundamentally change how we live and work.
Capital intensity at the leading edge is increasing to support a more diverse set of end used markets which provides confidence for strong multi-year WFE demand.
Our business is well balanced and both our product and service businesses have broad exposure across all device types.
This bodes well for UCT as we continue to engage in the early stages of customers' technology roadmaps.
The pre-close and integration planning process is going very smoothly and we are excited to begin operating as one company after closing likely early in the second quarter.
Adding Hamlet to our growing suite of vertical capabilities will support our customer partnerships with a significantly broader higher value, higher margin portfolio of market-leading product solutions.
You will recall that Hamlet's components are used primarily within our current gas panel product line as well as for gas distribution throughout semiconductor tools.
In addition, gas delivery is a significant element of the sub-fab infrastructure within chip making facilities, providing an additional platform for growth.
UCT's new facility in Malaysia remains on track to begin initial production in the third quarter this year.
There has never been a better and more opportune time to be a manufacturing leader in the semiconductor industry.
Our comprehensive portfolio of products and service offerings together with our strong fiscal discipline and resilient business model will drive continuous long-term performance and profitability with the goal of returning even more value to our shareholders.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone.
Thanks for joining us.
Total gross margin for the fourth quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.5% compared to 21% last quarter.
Total operating margin for the year was 11.3%, a significant improvement from 7.8% in the prior year due to higher volumes and ongoing management of expenses.
Based on 41.4 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.81 on net income of $33.5 million compared to $0.73 on net income of $29.9 million in the prior quarter.
For the full year earnings per share were $2.80 on net income of $115 million, compared to $1.16 on net income of $46.5 million in 2019.
For the full year our tax rate was 18.4%.
We expect our tax rate for 2021 to remain in the high teens.
For the full year, our cash from operations totaled $97.3 million.
We have made significant progress paying down our Term B loan over the last couple of years.
A key component of our overall growth strategy is to ensure we are ready to capitalize on expansion opportunities while maintaining an ideal level of operating leverage.
As mentioned in our last call, we are currently reviewing our capital structure to support this strategy so that we may conserve a healthy balance sheet and maintain flexibility.
We anticipate revenue for the first quarter to be between $375 million and $405 million and EPS in the range of $0.80 to $0.93.
Questions and Answers:

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Diffely with D.A.
Good afternoon.
First, I wanted to check on the Hamlet acquisition.
It sounds like the close has moved from the first quarter into the second quarter.
We really don't consider the close moving.
We talked about it being end of the first quarter, early second quarter and we are still projecting in that time frame, again most likely early second quarter.
Davidson -- Analyst

Okay.
Davidson -- Analyst

Okay.
That sounds good.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes, absolutely.
I mean, we always have a significant amount of first capacity and different things that we can do with overtime and extended shifts and things like that.
Obviously, as we see '21 and '22 continuing to strengthen in the long term that additional capacity in Malaysia is going to really pay off for us.
But, yeah, there'll be no constraints in the near term.
Davidson -- Analyst

Okay.
When you look at the kind of consensus view out there for 15% growth in the industry, everything you've seen correlate with that?
We see -- obviously the 15% number that a lot of people are talking about definitely seems like a reasonable estimate.
There have been a lot of announcements, especially in the foundry side of things to support that and as well as memory moving into more capacity adds in this year versus the node expansions that they were mostly focused on last year.
So we still think everything planning up really well for strong growth in that range for 2021.
Davidson -- Analyst

Great.
Thanks for [Phonetic] question.
So if you think WFE is going to be up 15% this year, is it fair to assume your revenues could be higher than that?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, obviously we're not guiding for all of 2021, but our target is to always outgrow WFE and we've outgrown that on an average of about 10 points over the last five or six years and obviously some years are higher and some are lower than others depending on many factors.
And then, Jim, I think in the last call you kind of spoke about some potential approved design wins at ASML.
I'm kind of curious, when do you think the transition to tangible revenue?
As I mentioned that's kind of a long-term goal over a few years and there are several reasons.
A lot of the wins and a lot of the work that we're doing are on the next-generation tools in the litho space.
And so those obviously have to go and get adopted and they have to ramp up on their own.
And also the wins -- the wins come in -- they come in chunks along the way.
So you see -- on any given quarter, you'll see several wins in certain sub modules and modules or components and those continue to kind of stack up on each other over time as well as the new tools really start to roll out as they introduce them to the market.
That's the -- that's where we see kind of a slow general growth over the next several years and our target to get that space up to a reportable segment.
Right now we see ourselves still at the high end of our model, especially now that we're starting to get into the $1.5 billion to $2 billion bucket that we put out in our model.
Thanks, Jim.
Thanks, Sheri.
I just want to make sure I got your comment correctly.
So it just really depends on the amount of volume going through.
The volume is really the key thing there in terms of how much goes through, but yes, it could be helpful to get us continue to have us be at the higher end of our gross margin model and possible expansion.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great.
The services business actually growing in the fourth quarter, surprised to say, I thought you were looking for potentially a step back in that business in the December quarter as one of your large customers went through a fab transition.
So just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the services business and do you expect that to grow in -- sequentially in the March quarter?
We saw some -- yeah, you're right, we definitely saw a temporary slowdown in the -- from the Israel logic site as we had talked about before.
We saw a little bit more strength in the memory side of things in Korea than what we had anticipated.
And then with the fab conversion kind of coming back in logic in Israel there, we would expect to see service continue to grow sequentially over the next quarters.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great.
I understand you're not giving guidance for the full year.
Has there been -- there has been some debate in the industry as to whether it's a front-half weighted year or more of a balanced or even a second-half weighted year.
Just any thoughts you have on kind of first half versus second half would be helpful.
Obviously the first half benefits from improved visibility and it looks pretty strong.
As we look at the end market fundamentals though, I think a lot of the second half and 2022 and increasing the strength kind of compounding from that it's kind of a little bit dependent on some more NAND capacity adds versus the technology moves and also memory, which is starting to add capacity continuing to accelerate.
I mean, obviously people call in the first half because that's where we could see pretty clearly.
It's really -- I think it's really too early.
The first half is pretty strong, very strong and then we see a lot of downstream indicators that there is no reason why the second half shouldn't continue.
But there is always the caveat of any unusual events that occur.
So it's really too early to say.
I think the entire year being pretty strong -- definitely there is a consensus on that and if there is any waiting, I don't think it would be significant.
That's kind of my view.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Great.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a really nice end to the year.
Jim, maybe first off staying on the services side for a second.
Maybe more specifically on memory both for NAND and DRAM as they get more complex, do you see increasing I guess content or increasing services use because of the complexities of those devices on top of high utilization rates?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption that definitely you could see the cleaning cycles accelerate like they are toward the leading nodes and not logic which would obviously cause a higher cleaning intensity, if you would.
And in addition to that, it also requires more of the leading edge kind of cleaning applications and more complex approaches to it, which obviously fits well into our bailiwick.
And then third, then you still have logic pushing some pretty extreme dimensions with 7 and 5 and 3 nanometer, which is adding new requirements to cleaning, which is -- so the coating and the texturing of the parts for yield and particle controls starting to become a more significant added process that you don't tend to see at those older node.
So I think there's kind of three factors that really come into play that should help the cleaning -- the cleaning and the analytics business to really maybe start to part ways with wafer starts and actually become grow a little faster.
But I think it's kind of early days to see how that happens.
But I think that's definitely something kind of cooking as those forces are building up.
You're also seeing a lot of those devices start moving into more vacuum based.
I think even some of the litho applications are starting to become more vacuum based.
So all those things added together bodes pretty well for that segment of the industry to really grow at an accelerated rate.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great.
Maybe as my follow-up question you guys performed really well last year in 2020 despite the pandemic issues.
Can you describe the supply chain situation that you have right now?
Obviously in the US and in Europe, to some extent too around the holiday season it was definitely something in the fourth quarter that we had to deal with with the suppliers UCTs hasn't been directly impacted in any way -- any significant way by any COVID events.
At this point in time it, knock on wood, it hasn't been anything that has been really materially impacting our ability to get our output.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great.
Thank you very much.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
Hey, Jim, I just have one quick question, follow-up on memory.
I mean, NAND is still kind of where we thought that people starting to continuing the transition to the 128 layers.
That was anticipated though, but we're starting to see some of that kind of pick up, but no real -- no real major capacity adds yet in NAND and NAND is still a little bit kind of like the last cylinder [Phonetic] to kind of really, really go forward with capacity.
DRAM is kind of moving along as we expected after the price has stabilized, after the utilization of the fabs, existing fabs went up.
So -- I mean, those things are happening, but I think that was kind of how we saw the year rolling out.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Okay.
Is that fair?
Yeah, the first indicator of those utilization rate is going up, yeah.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
No other questions.
Thanks, guys.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you very much for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results.
We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective.
The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, certain insurance proceeds, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This release and the accompanying tables include a discussion of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for UCT and Ham-Let, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful information because it provides UCT and investors with additional measurements to analyze past operating performance and enterprise value.
Safe Harbor Statement

This press release contains, or may be deemed to contain, "forward-looking statements" (as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: (1) the ability of UCT to successfully integrate Ham-Let's operations and employees; (2) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (3) UCT's ability to successfully grow its or Ham-Let's business; (4) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the completion of the transaction; (5) the retention of key employees, customers or suppliers; and (6) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry markets overall or the economy in general.
Forward-looking statements are made and based on information available to the company on the date of this press release.
We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, therefore imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors.
With billions of dollars in assets, smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd.
This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do (like Peltz's recent General Electric losses).
However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity.
With this in mind, as the current round of 13F filings has just ended, let’s examine the smart money sentiment towards Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UCTT).
Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UCTT) has seen a decrease in hedge fund interest of late.
Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UCTT) was in 20 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
The all time high for this statistic is 24.
Our calculations also showed that UCTT isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks).
Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.
We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market.
That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Lyon Street Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 2.56 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to UCTT.
Seeing as Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UCTT) has witnessed declining sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, logic holds that there exists a select few fund managers who were dropping their full holdings heading into Q4.

On the other hand iTeos Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITOS) is the least popular one with only 11 bullish hedge fund positions.
Ultra Clean Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UCTT) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average.

"Upon completion of this acquisition, UCT will be able to offer our existing semiconductor equipment customers a stronger and even broader set of offerings.
UCT will also gain access to a new set of customers in the semiconductor fab infrastructure and sub-fab market, which represents an excellent platform for growth."
"This transaction represents a significant benefit to Ham-Let, its employees, its customers and its shareholders," added Amir Widmann, CEO of Ham-Let.
We look forward to working closely with UCT to ensure a smooth transition."

Key Strategic and Financial Benefits

Additionally, Ham-Let has current relationships with many Original Equipment Makers ("OEM") and Integrated Device Manufacturers ("IDM") customers and is currently a supplier to UCT.
Ham-Let's high value, high purity components address a critical need increasingly demanded by leading OEM's and IDM's.
Annual cost synergies will be driven primarily from elimination of duplicate public company costs, elimination/combination of redundant facilities, operational efficiencies and other general administration areas.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results.
We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective.
The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.
This release and the accompanying tables include a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results.
We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective.
Story continues

The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

SOURCE Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.
The Nasdaq composite continued its upward momentum on Jun 23, closing at a record high of 14,271.73, primarily driven by a rally in Tesla TSLA shares after the electric vehicle-maker announced opening of its solar charging station with embedded power storage capacity in Lhasa.
Moreover, strong U.S. factory activity in June, per data available from IHS Markit, helped boost investor sentiments.
Markedly, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone to control inflation fears had spooked investors last week.
The central bank is now expected to make its first interest-rate hike in 2023 instead of 2024.
Higher inflation means increased borrowing costs as well as input costs.
As majority of tech companies rely on borrowing to expand their businesses, a higher inflation rate is detrimental to their prospects.
However, recent remarks of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which highlighted that central bank would consider a broad set of economic and labor market data before raising interest rates, soothed investor nerves and drove growth stocks, particularly from the tech sector.
Moreover, rapid adoption of hybrid work environment is expected to keep demand for PCs and laptops high.
Notably, the U.S. Senate has passed a bill that allocates $52 billion for the American semiconductor industry in an attempt to bolster chip manufacturing as well as improve competitive prowess against China.
Here we discuss five Nasdaq-listed stocks that are up more than 50% year to date and have room for further growth.
Per the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with such a perfect mix of elements offer solid investment opportunities.

There’ll be plenty of opportunities to get the best of both worlds at the same time.
But these days, investors pay more attention to the fancy-schmancy financial space when it comes to kicking things off.
But it really doesn’t matter whether you begin with bauxite or banks, we had a fantastic start to the season this year… and Alcoa was part of it.
The company said its first quarter performance was the best since 2018.
Earnings per share of 79 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 65%, making five straight quarters of positive surprises.
The average beat over the past four quarters was more than 56%.
Revenues of $2.87 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 7.9%, while also advancing from $2.38 billion a year earlier.
The company attributed these results to higher aluminum and alumina prices, along with increased shipments.
Analysts have been raising their expectations based on these strong results.
However, we’ve still got most of this year to go, and its apparent that expectations for next year are coming on strong.

Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT)



Earnings estimates for Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) have spiked in the past seven days since the company’s first-quarter results last week.
However, that’s nothing new for this semiconductor equipment services company, which has now beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nine consecutive quarters.
Anything having to do with semiconductors is a good place to be right now.
Therefore UCTT is on the right side of both supply and demand, which lead to a strong first quarter report.
Revenue of $417.6 million topped our expectation by more than 7% and advanced from the previous year’s $320.9 million.
The move expands UCTT’s semiconductor addressable market by more than $2 billion.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year rose 13.9% over the past 30 days to $3.86, while expectations for next year jumped 15.3% in that time to $4.38.
Discover Financial Services (DFS)



Companies with a strong digital presence had a head start on the pandemic-era economy.
That was true whether you sold clothes, computers or consumer loans.
DFS is a direct banking and payment services company that offers credit cards; personal, student & home loans; and deposit products.
The Direct Banking segment accounted for 88.3% of pretax income in 2020, while the Payment Services segment made up the remaining 11.7%.
In late April, the company reported its third straight positive surprise.
Fiscal first quarter earnings per share of $5.04 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a hefty 75%.
It’s strong and diversified Direct Banking business was a real standout in the quarter.
Along with its global expansions and strong balance sheet, DFS looks set to hit the ground running as the economy slowly but surely gets back on its feet.
DFS made many cost-curbing initiatives to stay healthy during this pandemic, which included reducing account acquisition expense, cutting down on brand awareness activities, and lowering the vendor and technology spending.
With a strong banking business and prudent management, analysts have been boosting their expectations over the past 60 days.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 43.2% in that time to $12.87, while next year has advanced 10.7% to $11.30.

Announcement: Moody's says Ultra Clean's announced acquisition of Ham-Let has no immediate effect on ratings

Global Credit Research - 17 Dec 2020

New York, December 17, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service said Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.

Ham-Let is current a supplier to Ultra Clean which presents a vertical integration opportunity.

What happened

Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings (NASDAQ:UCTT) popped on Thursday after the company reported revenue growth and profits exceeding expectations.
Ultra Clean Holdings was ranked No.
So what

There are many layers to the semiconductor industry, including manufacturing.
Ultra Clean Holdings provides critical subsystems (parts) to semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies like Lam Research and Applied Materials.
These subsystems, as the company's name implies, help keep everything clean -- crucial when manufacturing sensitive microchips.
Ultra Clean Holdings has operations in China and was negatively impacted by the coronavirus in the first quarter.
And EPS was toward the high end of guidance at $0.52 per diluted share.
Ultra Clean Holdings benefited from a quick recovery in manufacturing after an initial coronavirus shutdown.
Now what

Next quarter, Ultra Clean Holdings expects to generate revenue between $320 million and $360 million and EPS between $0.56 and $0.72.
However, even the low end of guidance reflects a marked improvement from the third quarter of last year.
Ultra Clean Holdings shareholders should be aware of a risk that isn't unique among critical subsystem companies.
A full 67% of the company's revenue comes from just two customers: Lam Research and Applied Materials.
In fact, Ultra Clean Holdings is expanding.
The move bodes well for Ultra Clean Holdings' future prospects.
Richard Herman Driehaus, renowned American businessman and fund manager, created an investment approach using the theory of buy high and sell higher.
This strategy is perfect for investors with the propensity to take high levels of risk.
Using this particular strategy, investors can buy momentum stocks.
The eventual success of this investment strategy helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.
The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns.
A Brief Note on Driehaus’ Strategy

Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.
Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included.
A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.
Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers.
Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.
Screening Parameters

In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B.
Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.
• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2%

Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business

• Trailing 12-month EPS growth greater than 0 and industry median

Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior earnings performance

• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5%

Solid EPS surprise history indicates better price performance

• Positive percentage change in 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks

Positive percentage change in 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend

• Momentum Score equal to or less than B

A favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.

Meanwhile, China EV makers Li Auto, Xpeng Motors and Nio all reported July sales that more than doubled vs. a year earlier.
Still, Nio stock rose 2.6%.
Overnight, Li fell modestly after announcing plans to sell an undisclosed number of shars.
A better time to buy BYDDF stock may have been Thursday, as it broke a trend line in its deep handle.
However, with Tesla Shanghai exporting both the Model 3 and Model Y to Europe, it's hard to get a good gauge on local demand except on a quarterly basis.

Market Rally Analysis

The stock market rally gave up modest morning gains.
In addition to breakouts such as Square and early entries such as Tesla stock, some leading stocks found bullish support, including CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Shopify (SHOP).
What To Do Now

If the weaker U.S. and China manufacturing indexes are merely a downshift or pause in a rapid global economy — with supply-chain and labor shortages providing an extended drag on many sectors — then stocks should be able to continue to advance.
But if economic growth cools significantly from here, it would weigh on equities, and not just real economy names.
So pay attention to economic data and upcoming reports such as Friday's jobs figures.
But, as with earnings, the economic news doesn't matter, it's the reaction to the news.
It's a confirmed stock market rally, but it's got some flaws and is not rushing ahead.

As the world continues its growing embrace of on digital activities, many analysts don’t expect the supply of semiconductors to meet the high demand anytime soon.
While the entire semiconductor industry is expected to continue rallying, fundamentally sound small-cap stocks in this sector may witness higher growth versus their large-cap counterparts.
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (AEIS), Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (UCTT), and ChipMOS Technologies, Inc. (IMOS) are semiconductor companies that are improving their offerings and capitalizing on rising demand.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Avnet, Inc. AVT, Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. UCTT, Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited AOSL, Healthcare Services Group, Inc. HCSG and Lifetime Brands, Inc. LCUT.
Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:

Picking Growth Stocks with More Room to Run

It’s perhaps a little early to be talking about emerging from the pandemic, but certainly the economy does appear to be emerging.
And that isn’t just true for the S&P 500.
But with so many companies coming out of the blues, how do we select the best?
So while I maintain that growth stocks must have revenue growth prospects (a strong demand environment that plays to the company’s strengths), in this environment, it’s a good idea to also check balance sheet strength.
One of the main things I check to determine balance sheet strength is the debt-cap ratio.
So, it’s understandable that they may need to raise cheap capital to fund the growth.
And that’s fine.
If a company has a low debt-cap but insufficient liquidity, it wouldn’t be able to function effectively and would perhaps not be able to fund its growth.
If the valuation also supports, these stocks are sure to outperform the market.
The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company belongs to the Electronics - Parts Distribution industry, which is in the top 2% of Zacks-ranked industries.
While the digital revolution has had a positive impact on most tech players, AVT shares have not appreciated as much.
In fact, the company is trading at 13.1X forward earnings, which is below the tech sector’s 26.9X multiple and also below its own median level of 16.2X over the past year.
The shares dropped on the news but the TI impact is temporary and the rest of the business remains very strong.
The company has a Growth Score B and Value Score B.

Ultra Clean Holdings

The company is a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment, flat panel, solar and medical device industries.
It is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.9X, which is below the tech sector’s 26.9X and also below its own median value of 13.2X.
The company’s surprise history is consistent, topping estimates in each of the last three quarters by a respective 26.8%, 66.7% and 14.1%.
The shares are up 9.3% appreciation over the past month and there’s much more room to run.
The company has a Growth Score A and Value Score B.

Alpha and Omega Semiconductor

The company designs, develops and distributes a broad range of power semiconductors globally, including Power MOSFET and Power IC products.
It is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.4X, which is below the tech sector’s 26.9X and also below its own median value of 18.7X.
AOSL’s surprise history is consistent, topping estimates in each of the last three quarters by a respective 175.0%, 61.1% and 7.8%.
The company is trading at 19.6X forward earnings, which is below the Business - Services sector’s 30.3X multiple and also below its own median level of 21.6X over the past year.
The company’s surprise history is consistent, topping estimates in each of the last three quarters by a respective 8.0%, 19.2% and 37.0%.
This may have brought share prices to the current attractive level.
So it has significant liquidity and flexibility in navigating through the current environment.
It is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.4X, which is below the Consumer Discretionary sector’s 31.8X and just above its own median value of 11.1X.
After missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for two straight quarters, Lifetime Brands came back strongly to beat the June and September quarter estimates by 58.3% and 30.0%, respectively.

Semiconductor equipment stocks rose Wednesday after chipmaker Intel (INTC) revealed a plan to spend $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona.
Gelsinger, who took over as CEO on Feb. 15, said he wants to return Intel to a leadership position in chip manufacturing.
He also announced Intel's plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe to serve customers globally.
Ichor Holdings (ICHR) advanced 2.8% to 46.15.
Lam Research (LRCX) rose 1.5% to 552.45.
Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) jumped 3% to 52.84.
Called 'Watershed Moment' For U.S. Chipmaking

Intel said its new chip fabrication plants will be located at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Ariz. Intel plans to expand capacity at other sites as well.
"This boost in spending will benefit the semicap names, but importantly, is also a potential watershed moment in the return of U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing," D.A.
Investments Could Weigh On Intel Stock

Wall Street analysts said Intel's plans are positive over the long term, but will weigh on its performance in the near term.
"We believe that Pat Gelsinger is doing absolutely the right thing for Intel by reinvesting in the company, but that his actions will almost necessarily weigh on earnings and cash flow over the next 2-3 years," Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in a note to clients.
"This conclusion is perhaps best illustrated by Intel's guidance for $10 billion in cash flow in 2021, well below the $17.3 billion (analyst estimate)."
"Overall, this was a positive event, showcasing the enthusiasm that Gelsinger is bringing back to the business," Moore said in a note to clients.
"Having said that, the challenges are still material in the nearer term, as we do see continued market share loss this year and into next," Moore went on to say, "but with valuation at a deep discount to the semiconductor group and prospects to stabilize share over the course of the next couple of years, we see those risks as largely priced in."

But the value rally may still be at an early stage, according to two fund managers from different companies who hold small-cap and mid-cap stocks.
The two mutual fund managers highlighted stocks that, they say, remain attractively priced.
At the bottom of this article are tables and charts showing how small- and mid-cap value stocks’ price-to-earnings ratios haven’t risen as much as those of the broad S&P indexes and their growth subsets.
When discussing the broad market rally since the pandemic bottom in March 2020, Tugman said the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus has pushed some investors to suspend “any common sense when it comes to valuation metrics.”

Following a long period during which growth stocks outperformed value, he believes investors’ expectations for a rapidly growing U.S. economy and rising interest rates will continue to bode well for value stocks.
Tugman said he and his colleagues tend to be “risk-averse.” When selecting new stocks for the portfolios they manage, they first consider downside risk, then focus on upside potential and come up with a risk/reward ratio.
They steer clear of highly leveraged or unprofitable companies and those facing “binary events,” such as biotechnology developers holding trials.
Tugman named three value stocks he believes are attractive today:

Citizens Financial Group Inc. CFG of Providence, R.I., is a regional bank with $183 billion in assets and about 1,000 branches in 11 states.
Tugman called the stock’s valuation “attractive at roughly 11 times estimated 2021 earnings.” He said the bank’s credit quality was strong and that it was well positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve.
Tugman called the stock’s valuation “attractive at roughly 11 times estimated 2021 earnings.” He said the bank’s credit quality was strong and that it was well positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve.
The stock has a forward P/E ratio of 14.8, which is on the high side for a bank.
He expects UCBI to continue growing its loan portfolio in the high single digits, which is an impressive organic growth rate for any bank.

He expects UCBI to continue growing its loan portfolio in the high single digits, which is an impressive organic growth rate for any bank.
Tugman said hotel closures during the pandemic had caused a “cash burn,” but that Sunstone’s balance sheet was still healthy.
During an interview, Stadlinger said that through 2019, small-cap growth stocks had been outperforming value for 10 years, because “when growth is scarce, the market pays up more for growth.” HE was referring to slow GDP growth in the U.S.
“[T]here will be a whole lot more money being spent.
“All the indicators are positive” for the company as the industry reopens at full strength, he said.
Four more companies mentioned by Stadlinger:

Herc Holdings Inc. HRI rents construction and earth-moving equipment.
The company is based in Florida and mainly operates in southern states, where commercial and residential construction activity is strong.
And Stadlinger believes a large round of federal infrastructure spending is “doable.”

And Stadlinger believes a large round of federal infrastructure spending is “doable.” Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. VAC is a timeshare operator.
If you own a timeshare with Marriott Vacations, you earn points that can be used to make exchanges with other timeshare properties operated by the company.
Stadlinger said that unlike hotel operators, timeshare companies have continued to collect maintenance fees from most customers during the pandemic.

Stadllinger described AUB as the “largest independent bank left” in Virginia, with “very strong management” and good prospects for loan growth as the economy improves.

Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. UCTT makes chemicals and equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers.
Stadlinger called UCTT “cheap” because of the growth prospects in its industry.
The growth groups tend to have higher price valuations and higher growth rates.
But a long-term look at forward price-to-earnings valuations for exchange traded funds that track the groups shows a remarkable trend — for mid-cap and small-cap stocks, P/E valuations for the value groups still appear relatively low.
First, let’s look at large-caps — here are the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE and the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG :

(FactSet)

For the large-caps, P/E valuations are high across the board, but less so for value.
Ultra Clean Holdings declined as much as 11% the day after its quarterly report hit the wires late last month.
So what

Ultra Clean CEO Jim Scholhamer noted the quarter's performance was "largely as expected, with a moderate sequential decline in our semiconductor capital equipment business off an excellent first quarter."
However, he also told investors that, after "recent announcements of spending push-outs from large semiconductor manufacturers," Ultra Clean anticipates lower capital equipment forecasts in the short term.
Now what

As such, Ultra Clean sees third-quarter revenue between $200 million and $220 million, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.28 to $0.38.
Here again, most people watching the stock were modeling Q3 earnings of $0.42 per share on significantly higher revenue of $246 million.
After all, those "spending push-outs" appear more than anything to be temporary delays in orders from some larger semiconductor clients.
But our market hates being told to essentially hurry up and wait, and it's no surprise to see Ultra Clean stock pulling back last month in response.

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment.
After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?
One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process.
Let’s put Synchrony Financial SYF stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:

PE Ratio

A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short.
This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world.
The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.
On this front, Synchrony Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.35, as you can see in the chart below:

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 27.9.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

We should also point out that Synchrony Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 8.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Synchrony Financial stock in the near term too.
This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better.
Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.
Right now, Synchrony Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.86.
This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 5.21 right now.
Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate,Synchrony Financial currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look.
Though Synchrony Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.
In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C. This gives SYF a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A.

Chipmaker Analog Devices Tops First-Quarter Targets, Guides Higher

See Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point
Stocks of chip makers have run way ahead of the broader market this year, but many are still relatively cheap — and when you consider the group’s growth prospects, they may still be a long-term bargain.
And the company also beat on the top line posting revenue of $18.3 billion which surpassed expectations of $18.1 billion.
True, this isn’t your parents GE.
And it bears little resemblance to the house that Jack built (a reference to GE’s long-time and legendary CEO Jack Welch).
However, the company that current CEO Larry Culp is steering is starting to look intriguing.
Once a Defensive Stock Always a Defensive Stock

General Electric was not a growth stock in its heyday, and it certainly isn’t one now.
However, the fact that an investor can easily name GE’s four business divisions is a stark contrast from just a few years ago.
The company that was one of the most recognizable, and beloved, dividend stocks cut its dividend sharply in 2018 as Culp took the helm.
And in this recent earnings report, the company provided an upward revision of free cash flow (FCF) for the year.
The company's largest business is power turbines and that appears to be undervalued right now.
A Reverse Split is Coming

In June, General Electric announced a 1-for-8 reverse stock split.
This means every eight shares of GE common stock issued and outstanding will combine into one share.
This is a logical next step for the company after it has spent time divesting itself of some business units.
The reverse stock split will better align GE’s number of shares outstanding with companies of our size and scope,” said Carolina Dybeck Happe, GE’s senior vice president and chief financial officer.
“It also marks another step in GE’s transformation to be a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial company.”

GE’s Turnaround is In the Early Innings

Analysts are forecasting a 10% increase in GE stock over the next 12 months.
GE is a turnaround story that is still in the early innings.
The company is clearly earning back the trust of institutional investors.
And that means that retail investors should find that owning shares of GE stock will be a sound investment.

Ultra Clean Holdings (NASDAQ: UCTT)

Ultra Clean Holdings is a California based developer and supplier of critical systems and subsystems for the semiconductor for the semiconductor capital equipment, flat panel, medical, energy and research industries.
Ultra Clean Holdings Earnings and Outlook

Ultra Clean Holdings announced its second quarter results early this morning.
The company was pleased to report $0.10 earnings per share for the quarter, exceeding the original analyst prediction of $0.50.
WKRB13.com

Ultra Clean Holdings CEO’s Comments

“Second quarter performance exceeded our expectations and we won important new business with semiconductor customers.
We continue to position UCT for future strategic investments that will extend our leadership position by focusing on the expansion of our capabilities for new and existing customers, winning new designs and improving profitability,” said Jim Scholhamer, UCT’s Chief Executive Officer.
Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the stock is right at the June 17 highs of $6.90, let’s see if the stock can break thru and hold that price and use it as a support level.
For the next significant price level that could be a resistance, we would have to go back to April 4, where it reached a high of $7.51.
The stock does have a wide yearly range as the 52 week high is $10.29 which it reached on August 19, 2014.
The stock also has a relatively low float of $25.7 million shares which shows it has the capability to run off the bell and making it a good candidate for the gap and go strategy.

The payments landscape is evolving at a truly astonishing pace, and a company like Square (NYSE:SQ) is at the forefront of its innovation.
Whether it's providing cutting-edge payment and point-of-sale solutions to merchants or offering consumers an easy way to handle their financial transactions with its Cash App, it’s safe to say that Square is a company that is disrupting the financial services industry.
Although the stock delivered incredible returns in 2020, there are plenty of reasons to believe that more upside is in store for Square investors given how quickly fintech solutions are penetrating the business world.
What’s great about investing in a company like Square is that its products and services are in demand from businesses worldwide.
The company also recently announced the launch of a banking business that could attract even more customers to its rapidly growing payment ecosystem.
If you are interested in a compelling fintech stock to own for the long-term, Square certainly fits the bill.
Here are 3 reasons why Square is a fantastic fintech stock:



Banking Business a Potentially Brilliant Strategic Move



This week, Square announced that it is launching a new product called Square Banking that could end up helping it become the go-to financial services company for small businesses around the world.
The new suite of financial products includes checking accounts, savings accounts, debit cards, and loans and is intended to help small business owners easily manage their cash flow.
While the prospect of traditional banking services isn’t necessarily a groundbreaking update, there are a few reasons why this is exciting news for the company.
Square is expanding its payments ecosystem dramatically with this strategic move and is now directly competing with the largest banks in the world.
It’s a bold move by the company that could pay off in a big way over the long term, which is a big reason to consider adding shares.
Cash App Momentum



Another reason why Square is a fantastic fintech stock is that it’s a multi-faceted company with several different areas of its business that are growing fast.
The company’s Cash App product particularly stands out, as it delivered strong Q1 revenue growth of 666% of $4.04 billion.
If you aren’t familiar with Cash App, it’s a peer-to-peer money transfer service that has a lot to offer.
Cash App clearly has a lot of momentum at this time, and it’s perhaps one of the most exciting components of Square’s business.
Consider some of the benefits of Cash App, which include no fees on basic services, free ATM withdrawals, cash bonuses for referrals, and the ability to invest all in one convenient application.
It will be very interesting to see how Cash App performed for the company in Q2 when Square reports its earnings on August 5th.
Huge Upside Internationally



It’s almost inconceivable to think that during Square’s last fiscal year, it only generated 6% of its total revenue internationally.
This tells us that the company has plenty of growth potential outside of the United States, which is another great reason why it's such an intriguing fintech stock.
The company’s payment and point-of-sale solutions can help small business owners simplify their financial framework regardless of where they are in the world, and there is a significant opportunity for the company to take market share from international competitors given its strong product portfolio.
The company also doubled its gross profit in Australia last quarter, the company’s largest international market at this time, which could be a sign of good things to come.
Whether it's providing payment solutions to restaurants, retail, or e-commerce businesses, it’s safe to say that the sky is the limit for Square if it can successfully expand its payments network to new countries.
When considering what names to put on your watch list, focus on stocks with an 80 or higher RS Rating.
X

When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, keep a close on eye on relative price strength.
History shows that the top-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.

But, now there is a slight chance that lawmakers may win approval for a fourth coronavirus stimulus check as Congress nears its long Fourth of July recess.
Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

Is there any chance of another coronavirus stimulus check?
Because of this, many Democrats are reportedly working to win approval for a beefed-up version of Biden’s "families plan."
This gives Democrats, in favor of another stimulus check, an opportunity to put forward their demand in exchange for supporting Biden’s "families plan."
Several Democrats are in favor of giving more stimulus checks to Americans, who are still struggling to pay for food, rent and utility bills.
More than 80 members of Congress reportedly support at least one more round of stimulus checks, including seven members of the influential House Ways and Means Committee.
Biden also indicated that there could be another bill, which will include the original families plan and the items excluded from the infrastructure package because of the compromise.
However, getting every Democrat on board won’t be easy, especially when some of their more conservative members balked at the last round of relief payments.
Meanwhile, much of the focus of lawmakers is on the expanded child tax credit, which is set to go out from next month.

Q2 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

However, the booming real estate business in the U.S. might prompt people to apply for reverse mortgages to –yes– invest in real estate.
Good Times For Investment?
In the last decade, several real estate markets in the U.S. have been money-focused, while many homeowners, despite the equity of their properties, are cash poor.
This is especially so among many owners above 60, who might weigh the option of borrowing against their home’s equity, to invest in real estate and secure a decent income flow.
They are also realizing that “their children or other heirs may not want their home when they pass on,” according to real estate investor Than Merrill.
“They certainly don’t seem to build houses like they used to.
In most cases, they probably can’t sell it fast enough.”

In this context, Forbes’ David Friedman says that growing fears over moderate-to-significant inflation will prompt people to invest in real estate.
That’s why they’re deciding to buy residential properties now, finance them at mortgage rates that are still near all-time lows, and generate cash flow by renting them out,” he says.
Real Estate Outlook

The possibilities for reverse mortgage are something to look at, bearing in mind the rebound in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
Story continues

“Changes in tax laws may make REITs more attractive due to their structure as pass-through entities that are largely immune to the impact of rising tax rates.”

As for reverse mortgages, Merrill underlines “how the equity in a home is contrasted with cashing it out to put a down payment on 10 other properties.
Reverse mortgages haven’t had a good reputation, due to rapacious prepayment clauses and an alleged lack of regulation.
This was due to the high cost of the product comprising several fees and closing costs, on top of mortgage insurance premiums.
In other cases, says Merrill, “borrowers far outlived their expectations and found they borrowed too much and had no equity.
That made it difficult for many to sell or move when home values dipped.”

However, partner at WBK James Milano said at the NRMLA Virtual Summer Conference in July: “Things are changing and evolving … minds are opening up … I really think the biggest frustration in our industry is that it seems to be taking so long.”

The change is due to the increasing regulation and reverse mortgage programs backed by the government.
This way, homeowners can use as much equity as they see fit, save for healthcare costs, and also avoid paying for a mortgage from the earned income.
Recommendations

People interested in real estate investment can look into reverse mortgages, always throwing both their life plan and the small print into the equation.
According to Investopedia, you must “explore how much you could get with each of the payment options available for reverse mortgages.”

Since the product is recommended as a solution for long-term problems, it is important that people don’t have the intention to move out of their homes.
Also, people should be fully capable of covering property ongoing costs such as taxes, home insurance, and maintenance, since not being able to do so would put the lender’s collateral at risk, declaring the loan due and payable.
While new laws protect your non-borrowing spouse from losing the home if you die first, they can’t receive any more reverse mortgage proceeds after you’re gone.”
Identifying stocks that offer healthy returns may sometimes pose a challenge to investors.
In that case, one may take into account liquidity levels, which are considered a good indicator of a company’s financial health.
However, high liquidity may also suggest a company’s inefficiency in utilizing its assets properly.
Thus, impressive liquidity positions and favorable efficiency levels imply a stock’s solid financial health.
Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets.
However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape.
Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.
Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio — also called “acid-test ratio" or "quick assets ratio" — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations.
Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.
Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities.
It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets.
Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.
So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.
Story continues

Screening Parameters

In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria.
Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.
Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)
Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)
These criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only 12.

It’s quite incredible how widespread 3D printing is becoming, especially within the manufacturing industry.
Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT) has announced that they have acquired a privately held company, Prototype Asia LLC, which they will integrate into their plans to open up a 3D printing service and launch their Additive Manufacturing Center in Singapore.
“While this [move] will have limited impact on our 2015 financial results, it is highly complementary to our existing offering and combining it with our existing contract manufacturing services will enable UCT’s customers to benefit from the latest state of the art technologies while allowing UCT to expand its market reach,” explained Clarence Granger, Chairman and CEO of UCT.
By expanding the company’s scope and offering a wider range of manufacturing capabilities, UCT should be able to provide a more comprehensive solution to businesses within the areas of aerospace, medical equipment, machinery, computers, electronics, and semiconductors.
The new 3D Printing Center will house numerous different types of 3D printers including those utilizing technologies such as fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, stereolithography, direct metal laser sintering, wax jetting, and more.
By offering manufacturing services which will enable weight reduction, customization, and the fabrication of new efficient designs, within time frames which were unheard of only a few years ago, UCT should be able to cater to a larger number of clients, both in Asia and worldwide.
“We are excited to base our new 3D Printing service in Singapore where we benefit from a stable business environment, a rich pool of talent and the government’s enthusiastic support of advanced manufacturing technologies.
The company expects the new center to open sometime in the first quarter of 2015, providing a wider range of options to their clients, and gradually expanding their market reach.

Optimism swept the broader market in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones hitting new highs to close out the year.
Decent earnings releases, hopes of economic recovery in 2021, positive developments on vaccines, and super-easy global monetary policy aided the markets in 2020 despite the COVID-19 challenges.
This made 2020 the best year for the index since 2009’s turnaround after surviving the Global Financial Crisis, per an article published on barrons.com.
Rising consumer spending on technology, coronavirus-induced social distancing leading to remote communications, a surge in e-commerce and online payments, stellar growth in the video-gaming segment, a 5G boom, and expectations of higher smartphone sales propelled the tech and semiconductor space in 2020, taking the Nasdaq to this height.
Will the Winning Momentum Continue in 2021?
New Strain of Coronavirus

There is a new strain of coronavirus, which can charge up the tech space in 2021 all over again.
The faster-spreading variant of the virus has been discovered in more places in the United States, including California.
Moreover, with the global economy striving to bounce back from the virus-led slump, corporate and social efforts to save on the cost structure will be a priority.
Biotechnology is another great area with genomics grabbing limelight.
Since the Nasdaq has great exposure to those two specific segments, 2021 has high chances of being a rewarding year for the index.
In fact, the Nasdaq’s relatively restrained gains in the fourth quarter of 2020 may open up some great opportunities in early 2021.
Past Record Shows More Possibilities for Nasdaq

The Nasdaq clocked double-digit gains for two years in a row in 2020.
The investors.com article went on to point out that since making its debut in 1972, the Nasdaq has logged four years of gains greater than 40%, according to Investor's Business Daily research.
The best year after such a monumental surge was a 16.9% increment in 2010, when the market was still struggling with the last financial crisis.
These stocks' estimated growth rates are stellar.
2020 Price Change: 67.1%

12-Week Price Change: 102.8%

2021’s Estimated Growth Rate: 660.7%

Growth Score: B

Advanced Energy Industries Inc. (AEIS)

Advanced Energy Industries is a power technology company.
2020 Price Change: 36.19%

12-Week Price Change: 42.60%

2021’s Estimated Growth Rate: 124.2%

Growth Score: B

5 Stocks Set to Double

Each was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020.
Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

The indices have gone almost straight up so far in 2017 and I've complained quite often about the lack of prudent entry points.
In general, I'd rather not buy stocks that have gone up every day for weeks.
While momentum does tend to last longer and go further than seems reasonable to most people, the odds of a reversal increase the more extended a chart becomes.
There is one circumstance I have found more favorable to the chase trade and that is when there is a big move triggered by very good news, such as exceptional earnings.
The typical reaction of many traders when a stock gaps up 10% or more on strong news is that they have missed the trade.
That is always my first thought when I see a stock that is at highs and appears extended.
What favors a chase when there is surprise news is that the market normally does not efficiently price in the news.
The truth is that the market struggles to calculate the value of a major surge in earnings and estimates.
They don't want to be too optimistic right away.
It is far better for their credibility to raise estimates gradually rather than raise them too much and then cut them back.
Another factor that favors the chase trade on good earnings news is that the stock will benefit not only from the higher EPS numbers but it may also see expansion in its P/E ratio.
It is the P/E expansion on top of the increased earnings estimates that can really ignite a stock.
This past week, I mentioned Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) as a stock that I was willing to chase following its earnings report.
If the market doesn't collapse and take the technology sector, there is a good chance this stock has some decent upside potential.
The first step is to establish a toehold.
It is important to make an actual buy rather than just watch because that helps establish your emotional commitment to the trade.
You are much more likely to follow the stock more carefully if there is money on the line.
Regardless of how you approach the add points, it is important to have some risk parameters in place where you will cut back your exposure if losses grow too much.
The overall goal is to buy incrementally as the market prices the stock more efficiently.
It works well when there is a large surprise and it takes a while for the market to fully appreciate it.
Stanley Druckenmiller said, "It's not whether you're right or wrong that is important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong."
Chasing a stock following very good news gives you the opportunity to be aggressive in seeking gains if you do it right.
All 45 sell-side analysts who cover Amazon.com rate the stock a “buy.” That is incredible, considering the shares trade for about 71 times the forward consensus earnings estimate, more than four times that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index.
How high are the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for other highly rated stocks?
Tomi Kilgore wrote about the risks associated with such strong sentiment for Amazon US:AMZN, as well as opportunities for short-term traders wishing to “play” the internet retail giant’s first-quarter earnings report Thursday after the stock market closes.
Among the S&P 500 US:SPX, a “perfect” list of sell-side ratings is a rarity.
Only one company besides Amazon is rated “buy” or the equivalent by all analysts polled by FactSet: Marathon Petroleum US:MPC has top ratings among all 19 analysts covering the company.
Marathon was recently included in this list from Barron’s: “10 stocks with safe, generous dividends.”

Reluctant to say ‘sell’

There is a reason why it is important to distinguish sell-side analysts (most of whom work for brokers who want their customers to buy shares) and buy-side analysts, who work for money managers.
The sell-side tends to be bright and sunny: Only two companies among the S&P 500 have majority “sell” or equivalent ratings:

• Campbell Soup US:CPB Nine of 16 analysts rate the stock a “sell” or the equivalent.
Interestingly, the shares are up 20% this year (including reinvested dividends), following a 29% drop in 2018.
Here’s a look at Campbell’s turnaround attempt and the results so far.
This is another recovery story so far in 2019, with the shares returning 20.5% after sliding 23% in 2018.
Looking for ‘perfect’ sets of ratings

If we expand our list to the S&P 1500 Composite Index, which includes the S&P 500, the Small-Cap 600 Index US:SML and the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index US:MID, there are 93 companies that all analysts consider a buy.
That is a tremendous number.
However, many are covered by a small number of analysts.
US:MPC 10.7 19 $61.06 $88.59 45% Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc.
US:LITE 13.7 17 $62.09 $69.19 11% Ultra Clean Holdings Inc.

OTTAWA, ON, March 21, 2021 /CNW/ -

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create stress and anxiety for many Canadians, particularly those who do not have ready access to their regular support networks.
Through the Wellness Together Canada online portal, people of all ages across the country can access immediate, free and confidential mental health and substance use supports, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
In parts of Canada, variants of concern represent an increasingly high proportion of cases, and are being associated with a greater number of outbreaks.
Each week, a new high is being set for the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered and we can expect more and greater benefits to come.
Over 670,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered this past week alone and more than 3.68 million doses have been administered to date across Canada as of March 19th.
Ensuring that all vaccines authorised for use in Canada are safe and effective is a priority for health authorities at every level, who continue to monitor, investigate & report through Canada's vaccine safety surveillance systems.
Story continues

Internationally, Health Canada has been working closely with other regulators to assess available information on the recent reports of rare blood clotting incidents following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.
However, it is possible that the vaccine may be associated with very rare but serious cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e.
This merits further analysis and Health Canada is continuing to work with international regulators to review new data and evidence as it becomes available, including as it pertains to these rare events.
Based on the information to date,Health Canada confirms that the benefits of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, in protecting Canadians from the severe outcomes of COVID-19, continue to outweigh any risks, despite a possible link to a rare type of blood clots associated with low blood platelets.
As the international body of evidence is evolving rapidly on this issue, I will continue to update Canadians with the latest information to assist in making informed decisions on COVID-19 vaccination.
As COVID-19 activity continues in Canada, we are tracking a range of epidemiological indicators to monitor where the disease is most active, where it is spreading and how it is impacting the health of Canadians and public health, laboratory and healthcare capacity.
The following is the latest summary on national numbers and trends, and the actions we all need to be taking to reduce infection rates, while vaccination programs expand for the protection of all Canadians.
We now have multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines with unique advantages that are authorised for use in Canada.
However, nationally, COVID-19 activity has levelled off at a high level since mid-February and average daily case counts are now on the rise.
The latest national-level data show a 7-day average of 3,297 new cases daily (Mar 12-18).
In addition, circulation of COVID-19 in younger, more mobile and socially-connected adults presents an ongoing risk for spread into high-risk populations and settings.
The emergence and spread of certain SARS-CoV-2 virus variants heightens this concern.
For the week of March 7-13, there were on average of 102,676 tests completed daily across Canada, of which 3.2% were positive for COVID-19.
Provincial and territorial data indicate that an average of 2,057 people with COVID-19 were being treated in Canadian hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (Mar 12-18), including 561 of whom were being treated in intensive care units.
While vaccine programs accelerate, it will be important to maintain a high degree of caution.
In particular, there must be sufficient contact tracing capacity and supports for effective isolation, given increased transmissibility of variants of concern.
Canadians are urged to remain vigilant, continue following local public health advice, and consistently maintain individual practices that keep us and our families safer: stay home/self-isolate if you have any symptoms, think about the risks and reduce non-essential activities and outings to a minimum, avoid all non-essential travel, and maintain individual protective practices of physical distancing, hand, cough and surface hygiene and wearing a well-fitted and properly worn face mask as appropriate (including in shared spaces, indoors or outdoors, with people from outside of your immediate household).
Aiming to have the fewest interactions with the fewest number of people, for the shortest time, at the greatest distance possible, while wearing the best-fitting mask is a simple rule that we can all apply to help limit the spread of COVID-19, as vaccine programs expand to protect all Canadians.
Canadians can also go the extra mile by sharing credible information on COVID-19 risks and prevention practices and measures to reduce COVID-19 in communities and by downloading the COVID Alert app to break the cycle of infection and help limit the spread of COVID-19.

The monetary forces that have helped feed the bull market are so strong that scores of stocks have risen significantly over the past year even as the companies themselves have been losing money.
A list of some of the best performers among the money losers is below.
In a Wall Street Journal article, James Mackintosh called Tesla US:TSLA and General Electric US:GE “the two most valuable loss-making companies,” after Tesla’s shares had doubled in three months and GE’s stock had risen 44%.
Tesla’s shares have risen after the electric-car maker reported a third-quarter profit, opened a China factory in the fourth quarter and enjoyed a spike in demand.
Of this group, 149 of the stocks have returned 50% or more over the past 12 months through Jan. 12, with dividends reinvested.
That is such a large list that we turned to the S&P Composite 1500 Index, which is made up of the large-cap S&P 500, the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index US:MID and the S&P Small-Cap 600 US:SML.
One of these is that it most show four quarters of profitability.
Among the S&P 1500, there are 211 companies that have lost at least a penny a share for the most recently reported four quarters combined through Jan. 12.
US:CUTR 158% -$2.62 6% 56.88% 52.75% Ultra Clean Holdings Inc.

To be sure, many of these stocks recovered from previous declines as investors became enthusiastic about management teams’ turnaround efforts.
The table includes sales-growth numbers as well as gross margins for the most recently reported quarter and the year-earlier quarter.
An expending margin, especially when sales are growing, is a positive sign that a company is remaining competitive.
Gross margin isn’t used in the banking, insurance and real estate investing industries.
It is most useful to gauge a single company’s pricing power over time.
It doesn’t make for useful comparisons across industries.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Ultra Clean Technology Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us.
For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors section in our SEC filings.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Rhonda and good afternoon, everyone.
By maximizing our current market position and capabilities and consistently working to meet customer demand, UCT again reached new revenue and EPS milestones.
Total revenue for the second quarter was just over $515 million, a 50% increase year-over-year and EPS grew 32% to nearly $1.
This track record combined with our commitment to investing in our future paves the way for a very exciting roadmap for growth in 2021 and beyond.
As the semiconductor industry continues to be stretched by record high demand, we are leveraging our leading position as a partner of choice to help our customers and their customers accelerate the rapid migration toward next generation devices.
The global semiconductor industry has historically been driven by demand from electronics such as smart phones and computers.
More recently, continued enhancement of existing products and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as AI, 5G networks and high performance computing applications are creating sustained demand increases across a much broader end market.
This megatrend is enabling greater visibility with multi-year record breaking industry capex plans for leading and trailing edge capacity to support the extent of that [Phonetic].
UCT's broad spectrum of products and services are increasingly relevant to the success of our customers and this gives us a significant competitive advantage.
We are one of the few semiconductor focused manufacturers with the proven ability to sustainably support the dynamic product roadmaps and stringent quality levels required for advanced chip manufacturing.
To ensure we are ideally positioned to deliver value quickly and efficiently to our customers worldwide, we are making strategic investments to expand our capacity to provide additional leading edge and specialty capabilities to support our growth strategy over the long term.
Our new state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia is on schedule and customer qualifications are beginning this month.
Fortunately, we are located at Northern Malaysia where COVID cases remained low compared to the rest of the country.
We remain on track to start initial production in early September and expect to progressively ramp this year and into 2022 to meet our customers' increasing needs.
The timing of this additional capacity is a deal as it strategically expands our capabilities on existing and new customer platform and an optimal time.
Our product capacity expansion program stretches beyond Malaysia and include strategic investments designed to capture that many significant profitable growth opportunities we see.
Not only a wafer fab production equipment, but also in service, sub-fab [Phonetic] support equipment and fab infrastructure as well as the industry continues to transform at a very rapid pace.
We will continue to engage with our customers to design, manufacture and service the best products in the best way possible to address their needs in a sustainable manner.
The global pandemic continues to be a risk factor as the Delta variant is spreading quickly across many regions.
Our growing suite of capabilities, additional capacity, strong balance sheet ideally positions us to capitalize on the robust demand trends returning considerable value to our shareholders over the long term.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone.
Thanks for joining us.
Our Products division was up 28% to $442.5 million, which includes nearly a full quarter of revenue from Ham-Let amounting to $58.2 million.
Total gross margin for the second quarter remains at the high end of our model at 21.2% compared to 21.3% last quarter.
Margins can be influenced by customer concentration, geography, product mix and volumes, sure [Phonetic] there will be variances quarter-to-quarter.
Total operating margin for the quarter was 11.7% compared to 12.2% in the first quarter.
Based on 44.3 million shares outstanding, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.99 on net income of $43.7 million compared to $0.92 on net income of $38.2 million in the prior quarter.
We expect our tax rate for 2021 to stay in the high teens.
A significant portion of the increase was a result of the equity offering in April, 2021.
We have recast our arrangement to purchase additional shares of the JV to remain much more flexible.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question.
First one for Jim on Sheri.
Just a quick housekeeping question.
How much is Ham-Let in your September guidance?
Okay, fair enough.
Thanks, Sheri for that.
We certainly are not forecasting out through December or through the March quarter.
But I think it's safe to say that all throughout the industry, we see a pretty solid forecast out through the end of the year and into next year.
At this point, it's really a case for the whole industry more gated by the ability to really produce the WFE tools rather than orders, orders on hand.
So I think we see an unusually long trail of orders heading out several quarters which normally we don't see.
I just want to check on the operating leverage, clearly revenue has increased in June, but margins were kind of flattish, and then kind of the guidance based on September, it looks like revenue is improving but EPS is kind of still not that much.
So is Ham-Let unique [Phonetic] or do you think that incremental operating leverage kind of waning now that the easy moves up.
We anticipate that we'll be able to get them into our products range of 8% to 10% in the next couple of quarters.
So that's really the one of the key contributors as well as we have to continue to add specific [Technical Issues] so that we can continue to grow, so that we will continue to work on that as we have look forward.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Thanks, Sheri.
Thanks, Jim.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Welcome.
And do you feel that your business is constrained through your manufacturing footprint or do you think you should be able to meet demand based on your manufacturing capacity today?
Thanks, Quinn.
I think overall, we're doing a pretty good job of keeping up with demand and making the deliveries that we're expected to make.
It's more a case of the ability of the whole industry to really absorb the other parts.
If we make a module on time or we make a tool on time, there's other elements to that have to also be ready.
So I think it's really a case where the whole industry, our customers and our peers are also kind of hand in the mouth right now.
So even when we're able to make deliveries, we're a little bit constrained when the whole -- the whole tool is ready to go, if you would.
So, but I think we're doing, we're doing a pretty good job and keeping up.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, thanks for that question.
Demand is really strong across the board for Ham-Let we're definitely making progress with all the engineering and drawings changes needed to really set that up, the book to bill in that business is really high right now.
And so that work where we're doing the qualifications and getting in place is really setting us up for next year and I think at this point, we're doing everything we can be kind of increase the capacity of Ham-Let to just to meet the orders on hand is definitely, I'd say around the time that we closed on the business we saw orders really spiked up pretty dramatically in that space.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

That's great.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, absolutely.
This was something that was put in place by quantum clean QuantumClean before we purchased them.
As a result, we were able to consolidate profits up 86%.
And we still own a majority of the JV, greater than 50% and really what it allows us to do is it gives us as, as we continue to look at M&A is core to our strategy, it really allows us to maintain flexibility with our capital.
So that is more beneficial to shareholders.
And if we decide we want to buy up to that amount we will, but it just gives us more optionality versus obligation.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

So, will you just effectively be recording a higher minority interest so that you historically had 86% of that JV flowing through your income statement, and now that it's, you don't have the obligation, you'll have a lower than 86% of profits effectively flowing through the income statement.
So you'll see a little bit larger back out a profit in the other income and interest line and that's what the effective three to four senses.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

You're welcome.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook.
Jim maybe to follow-up on -- for the capacity constraint question, I look at it from a different angle of supply constraints, based on your results and outlook, it looks like you manage that very well.
One, did you experience any, I guess, meaningful supply constraints.
And secondly, if not, what have you've been doing differently or have you been able to procure the necessary supply to keep up with your customers' end demand?
Thanks, Patrick.
We've definitely had some level of constraint happening from some of the kind of build -- built-in OPMs, we call them original part manufacturers, so that definitely throttled back our ability.
We could have delivered more revenue.
But we could have delivered more if we had been able to secure more of some of those OPM parts.
And some of our competitors were that we were able to pick up some additional business within this quarter and probably this quarter a little bit as well.
Overall, I would say we've been able to meet the customers' needs.
But because of some of those constrictions we were, capably were constrained on delivering the amount of revenue.
We could have delivered more revenue in this quarter without those issues.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great, that's helpful.
But given the -- I guess the high demand that we're seeing out there, am I right to assume that you could absorb that capacity faster and I guess, the normal time start-up cost could be a little bit less and you can get gross margins or I guess you can keep gross margins at these elevated levels because of the high demand.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I do think that we are able to absorb the majority of those costs.
Malaysia is going to really be something that's probably more impactful to 2022.
But I think as we slowly started up, I don't see there being a huge, huge drag on our margin as a result of that.
Patrick O'Rourke -- Stifel -- Analyst

Great, thank you very much.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hey guys, congrats on another good quarter and outlook.
Can you help us understand what the -- remind us probably, how much revenue you could get from the Malaysian facility in '22 and it would it be running at full capacity by the end of '22 or do you think it would take longer?
Yeah, the full capacity when it's all built out in two to three years, the maximum is roughly around $600 million in revenue.
There's always some legal room in there as well.
But roughly a third of that is available, will be -- is available right now and we expect to have that kind of build out by the end of the next year.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
And given kind of the tightness in the strength of the wafer front-end equipment market integral [Phonetic] are you already securing orders for your September production and end of '22 for that facility as we sit here today.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, one of the phenomena that we're seeing is a lot more working together with our customers to secure long lead time deals from them, which therefore we are able to cover that -- cover those deals back to our supply chain.
So we're getting a lot of great cooperation from our customers to really put the money down and put the orders in and work, then we're able to lay out long-term orders with the supply chain.
So I think we're in good shape.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, definitely, absolutely, I mean, obviously this year, if you look at the inorganic, the acquisition of Ham-Let, that kind of puts us already in that in that territory.
And then on top of that, we're doing very well with the organic side of our growth equation, which is share gain, continued outsourcing that we're seeing from our customers, continued penetration of little, deliver space where we're heavily engaged.
So I think I am very confident that this year we will do -- we will easily hit the 10 points and hopefully much beyond that.
Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Great.
No other questions.
Thanks, guys.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
So Jim, can you give us your views on WFE and wafer starts kind of the second half of this year and maybe some commentary on next year?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think WFE, I think a lot of the prognosis is, I think we're in pretty, pretty much the same boat as our customers.
I think we kind of see that there.
Wafer starts are a little bit slower, just because the fab they're running full out, so there's is no utilization to really soak up, so the wafer starts are growing as the equipment goes in.
So we're seeing wafer starts growth, but it's really at this point a little bit tapped out due to I think every single fab that we know is running at full capacity.
So I think I think we're in pretty much lockstep with what the big OEMs like a pioneer what you're saying I think which is roughly $80 million to $85 million.
And I think also, they're are also predicting a pretty strong 2022 as well.
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Okay.
How much revenue was pushed out of the quarter with the constraints that you saw?
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

I mean I think I wouldn't say pushed out, but I would definitely term it, we probably could have done another $20 million, $30 million or so, but I think many companies have the same story.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

I think one of the things that we're still trying -- still seeing is, freight cost being quite high, I think a lot of companies are seeing that as being kind of one of those expenses that have come in higher than we had pre-COVID.
So I would say that that's something that I would anticipate probably being ongoing, but I think the margin still did very well despite having such expenses flow through.
Dick Ryan -- Colliers -- Analyst

Sure.
Sheri Savage -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
Jim Scholhamer -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Dick.
And we really look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Thank you very much.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results.
We believe the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing our core business and business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective.
The Company currently defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition costs, fair value adjustments, depreciation adjustments, stock-based compensation, certain insurance proceeds, and the tax effects of the foregoing adjustments.

The Nasdaq composite continued its upward momentum on Jun 23, closing at a record high of 14,271.73, primarily driven by a rally in Tesla TSLA shares after the electric vehicle-maker announced opening of its solar charging station with embedded power storage capacity in Lhasa.
Moreover, strong U.S. factory activity in June, per data available from IHS Markit, helped boost investor sentiments.
Markedly, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone to control inflation fears had spooked investors last week.
The central bank is now expected to make its first interest-rate hike in 2023 instead of 2024.
Higher inflation means increased borrowing costs as well as input costs.

However, recent remarks of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which highlighted that central bank would consider a broad set of economic and labor market data before raising interest rates, soothed investor nerves and drove growth stocks, particularly from the tech sector.
Moreover, rapid adoption of hybrid work environment is expected to keep demand for PCs and laptops high.
Notably, the U.S. Senate has passed a bill that allocates $52 billion for the American semiconductor industry in an attempt to bolster chip manufacturing as well as improve competitive prowess against China.
