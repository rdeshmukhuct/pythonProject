    --> An explanation for this issue is that Google server refuses my connection, because I am sending too many
        request from the same ip address in a short time period.

        ->> to try and overcome issue, I will try to catch connection related exceptions. example

         {      try:
                    page1 = request.get(ap)
               except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
                    r.status_code = "Connections refused"
         }

         or try using a time gap to send requests to server by using { sleep(timeinsec) }  func in python.
         > from time import sleep. <-- this is the import needed to use sleep(timeinsec).
